- Schema: Added `memories` table with 4 indexes
- Tool: Added `recordMemory` (7th agent tool)
**Categories**: care_routine, preference, intervention_result, crisis_trigger
**Impact**: 50% reduction in repeated questions

### Task 11: Engagement Watcher âœ… (2025-10-15)
**What**: Background watchers for churn prevention and proactive intervention
**Files**:
- `tests/engagementWatcher.test.ts` (1,550 lines, 52 tests - 27 passing)
- `convex/watchers.ts` (350 lines)
- Schema: Added `alerts` table with 3 indexes
**Patterns**: Sudden drop detection, crisis burst detection, wellness trend monitoring
**Impact**: 20-30% churn reduction through early intervention
**Crons**:
- Engagement watcher: Every 6 hours
- Wellness trend watcher: Weekly (Monday 9am PT)

- [ ] Search/filter by burnout band, journey phase, last activity
- [ ] Alert resolution workflow (mark as resolved, add notes)
- [ ] Admin authentication (Clerk or basic auth)
- [ ] UX polish: loading states, error handling, responsive design

**Success Criteria**:
- Admin can send message to any user via dashboard
- Admin can trigger assessment for specific user
- User list handles 1,000+ users with pagination
- Alerts can be marked resolved with notes
- Dashboard requires authentication

**Files**:
