## Critical Warnings & Considerations

### Admin Dashboard

**Security**:
- Admin-only authentication required (not phone OTP - use separate admin auth)
- Row-level security for sensitive user data
- Audit logging for all admin actions (future requirement)
- Rate limiting on admin mutations

**Performance**:
- Pagination for user table (load 50 at a time)
- Debounced search/filter (avoid excessive queries)
- Cached aggregations for analytics (refresh every 5min)

**Privacy**:
- Anonymize phone numbers in exports (last 4 digits only)
- HIPAA compliance considerations (future)
- User consent for data access (already captured)

### User Dashboard

**Authentication**:
- **Decision needed**: Supabase Auth vs Convex Auth
  - Supabase: Already used in `give-care-user`, familiar
  - Convex: Simpler, all-in-one, fewer dependencies
  - **Recommendation**: Convex Auth (reduce vendor lock-in)

**Mobile-First**:
- 80%+ users on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
- Swipe gestures for navigation (future)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) install prompt (future)

**Offline Support** (Future):
- Service worker for offline viewing
- Sync when connection restored
- Show cached data with "offline" indicator

### Evaluation Framework

**GEPA Risks**:
- **DO NOT** blindly deploy GEPA-optimized prompts
- **MUST** have clinical advisor review all variants
- **WATCH** for "performance over empathy" optimization
- **PRESERVE** P1-P6 trauma-informed principles
- **TEST** with diverse user scenarios (edge cases)

**Sample Size**:
- GEPA needs 100+ rated conversations (4+ stars)
- A/B test needs 500+ users per variant (1000 total)
- 30-day minimum duration for statistical significance

**Metrics That Matter**:
- Empathy score (most important)
- Trauma-informed adherence (P1-P6 checklist)
- User satisfaction (1-5 stars)
- Crisis escalations (safety metric - cannot increase)
- Response time (cannot degrade)

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

1. **Auth Strategy**: Supabase Auth vs Convex Auth for user dashboard?
   - Recommendation: Convex Auth (simpler, fewer dependencies)

2. **Admin Auth**: How do admins authenticate?
   - Options: Email/password, OAuth (Google), Magic link
   - Recommendation: Email/password (Convex Auth)

3. **Dashboard Hosting**: Vercel vs Cloudflare Pages?
   - Recommendation: Vercel (better Next.js integration, easier setup)

4. **Intervention Rating**: In-SMS vs web-only?
   - Recommendation: Both (in-SMS for immediate feedback, web for browsing)

5. **GEPA Timeline**: When to revisit?
   - Earliest: 6 months after production launch (100+ rated conversations)
   - Target: 2026-04-10 (if launched 2025-10-10)

6. **Analytics Rollups**: Real-time vs pre-aggregated?
   - Recommendation: Hybrid (real-time for critical metrics, rollups for charts)
