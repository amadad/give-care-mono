**Geographic Focus**: United States

---

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Positioning**: GiveCare is a **B2B2C digital health platform** that sells to organizations (health plans, employers, hospitals, CBOs) while serving caregivers directly via SMS.

**Primary Revenue Model**: Enterprise contracts (80% of revenue target)
**Secondary Revenue Model**: Direct-to-consumer subscriptions (20% of revenue, accessibility mandate)

**Value Proposition Matrix**:

| Customer Type | Problem | Solution | ROI Metric |
|---------------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Health Plans & Payers** | Caregiver stress → patient readmissions | SMS guidance reduces avoidable utilization | -15-30% readmissions = $2-4M savings/year |
| **Employers & Benefits** | Caregiver absenteeism, turnover | Text support improves retention & productivity | -$5,600/caregiver/year productivity loss |
| **Community Orgs (CBOs)** | Can't scale support requests | 24/7 SMS handles routine questions | 10x support capacity with same staff |
| **LTC & Senior Living** | Anxious families call constantly | Direct text support reduces call volume | -40% family phone calls to staff |
| **Advocacy & Patient Groups** | Volunteers can't do 24/7 support | SMS triages routine vs complex cases | 5x volunteer productivity |
| **Hospitals & Health Systems** | Post-discharge caregiver struggles | Text transition support improves outcomes | -20% 30-day readmissions |

## Part 1: Enterprise Market Segmentation

### 1.1 Priority Customer Segments (Tier 1)

#### Health Plans & Payers

**Target Profiles**:
- Medicare Advantage plans (5-star quality focus)
- Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (LTSS populations)
- Commercial health plans (caregiver-heavy employer groups)
- ACOs (Accountable Care Organizations)

**Decision Makers**:
- Chief Medical Officer (clinical outcomes)
- VP Population Health (care management)
- VP Member Experience (HEDIS, NPS)
- Innovation/Digital Health Director (pilots)

**Pain Points**:
1. **Readmissions**: Family caregivers unprepared → patient returns to hospital
   - Cost: $15,000-$25,000 per readmission
   - Penalty: CMS reduces reimbursement for excess readmissions
2. **HEDIS Scores**: Poor follow-up medication adherence (caregiver forgets)
   - Impact: Lower star ratings = reduced bonuses ($1M+ at risk)
3. **Member Satisfaction**: Stressed caregivers complain about lack of support
   - Impact: NPS decline, member churn to competitors
4. **Medical Costs**: Caregiver burnout → patient neglect → ER visits
   - Cost: $300-$1,000 per preventable ER visit

**GiveCare Solution**:
- **Transition of Care SMS Program**: Daily check-ins for 30 days post-discharge
  - "Did [patient] take their blood pressure medication today?"
  - "Any warning signs? Shortness of breath, swelling, confusion?"
  - Alerts care team if caregiver reports issues
- **Medication Adherence Reminders**: Proactive SMS at medication times
  - "Time to give [patient] their 2pm insulin. Need help remembering dosage?"
- **Crisis Escalation**: Detects caregiver burnout → connects to care manager
  - "Your burnout score is high. Would you like to speak with a care coordinator?"
- **Assessment Integration**: CWBS, REACH-II scores shared with care management
  - Care managers can prioritize high-burnout caregivers

**Value Proposition**:
- **15-30% reduction in 30-day readmissions** (industry benchmark: 10-15%)
  - For 100,000 members, 5% caregiver population = 5,000 caregivers
  - Assume 20% of patients have readmissions → 1,000 readmissions/year
  - 20% reduction = 200 fewer readmissions × $20,000 = **$4M saved/year**
- **Improved HEDIS medication adherence** (+5-10 percentage points)
  - Higher star ratings = $500k-$1M bonus for Medicare Advantage plan
- **Reduced care management overhead** (AI handles routine questions)
  - Care managers focus on complex cases, not "how do I give insulin?" calls

**Pricing Model**:
- **PMPM (Per Member Per Month)**: $0.50-$1.50 for all eligible members
  - Example: 100k members × $1 PMPM = $100k/month ($1.2M/year)
- **Per Engaged Caregiver**: $5-8/caregiver/month (only pay for active users)
  - Example: 5k caregivers × $6 = $30k/month ($360k/year)
- **Hybrid**: $0.25 PMPM base + $5/engaged caregiver
  - Aligns incentives (plan pays for reach, only pays more for usage)

**Sales Cycle**: 9-12 months (RFP, pilot, clinical validation, contracting)

**Contract Size**: $300k-$2M/year (100k-500k members)

---

#### Employers & Benefit Providers

**Target Profiles**:
- Mid-to-large employers (1,000+ employees)
- High caregiver industries: Healthcare, education, government, retail
- Benefits consultants/brokers (channel partners)
- Third-party administrators (TPAs)

**Decision Makers**:
- VP Human Resources (talent retention)
- Benefits Director (EAP, wellness programs)
- CFO (absenteeism costs, turnover ROI)
- Chief People Officer (employee experience)

**Pain Points**:
1. **Absenteeism**: Caregivers miss 6.6 days/year more than non-caregivers
   - Cost: $150/day × 6.6 days × 20% employees = $2,000/caregiver/year
2. **Turnover**: Caregivers leave at 2x the rate of non-caregivers
   - Cost: $50,000-$150,000 replacement cost per employee
3. **Productivity Loss**: Stressed caregivers perform 15-20% below baseline
   - Cost: $5,600/caregiver/year (Torchlight research)
4. **Healthcare Costs**: Caregiver burnout → their own health claims
   - Cost: +$2,000/year in medical claims for burned-out caregivers

**GiveCare Solution**:
- **Employee Caregiver Benefit**: Offered via benefits portal
  - "Sign up for 24/7 caregiver support via text"
- **Proactive Stress Checks**: Weekly SMS asks "How are you managing this week?"
  - Detects early burnout → nudges to EAP or manager conversation
- **Resource Navigation**: "Need respite care? Here's subsidized daycare in your zip code"
  - Connects to employer-sponsored benefits (senior care, backup care)
- **Manager Alerts** (with consent): "Employee X is showing burnout signals"
  - HR can proactively offer flexible schedule, leave, or support

**Value Proposition**:
- **Reduce turnover by 20-30%** among caregiver employees
  - If 20% of 10,000 employees are caregivers = 2,000 caregivers
  - Baseline turnover: 15% = 300 caregivers leave/year
  - 25% reduction = 75 fewer departures × $75k replacement = **$5.6M saved/year**
- **Reduce absenteeism by 30-40%** (proactive support prevents crises)
  - 2,000 caregivers × 6.6 days × 30% = 4,000 days saved × $150 = **$600k/year**
- **Improve employee engagement** (+10-15 NPS points)
  - Caregivers feel supported → higher retention, advocacy

**Pricing Model**:
- **Per Employee Per Month (PEPM)**: $6-10 for all employees (not just caregivers)
  - Example: 10,000 employees × $8 PEPM = $80k/month ($960k/year)
- **Per Caregiver User**: $5-8/active caregiver/month
  - Example: 2,000 caregivers × $7 = $14k/month ($168k/year)
- **Recommended**: Per-user pricing (more affordable for employers, easier to justify ROI)

**Sales Cycle**: 6-9 months (benefits planning, pilot, annual enrollment)

**Contract Size**: $100k-$1M/year (5,000-20,000 employees)

---

### 1.2 Secondary Customer Segments (Tier 2)

#### Community-Based Organizations (CBOs)

**Target Profiles**:
- Area Agencies on Aging (AAA)
- Caregiver support nonprofits (Family Caregiver Alliance, AARP local chapters)
- Faith-based organizations (church elder care ministries)
- Alzheimer's Association chapters

**Decision Makers**:
- Executive Director (program reach, impact)
- Program Director (caregiver services)
- Development Director (grant funding alignment)

**Pain Points**:
1. **Overwhelmed Staff**: 1 social worker can't handle 500 caregiver requests
2. **Limited Hours**: Only available 9am-5pm, but caregivers need 24/7 support
3. **Routine Questions**: "How do I apply for respite vouchers?" asked 100x/week
4. **Grant Requirements**: Funders want "number of caregivers served" metrics

**GiveCare Solution**:
- **White-Label SMS Platform**: Branded as "[CBO Name] Caregiver Support"
  - "Text us anytime at [shortcode], powered by AI + our staff"
- **AI Handles Tier 1 Questions**: Benefits, eligibility, resources in area
  - Human staff only handle Tier 2/3 (complex cases, crisis intervention)
- **Dashboard for Staff**: See all caregiver conversations, step in when needed
  - "AI suggested 3 respite care options, caregiver needs help choosing"
- **Grant Reporting**: Auto-generate "caregivers served, engagement hours, outcomes"

**Value Proposition**:
- **10x support capacity** with same staff size
  - Before: 1 social worker handles 50 caregivers (1:50 ratio)
  - After: AI handles routine, social worker manages 500 caregivers (1:500 ratio)
- **24/7 availability** without hiring night staff
  - Cost savings: $50k/year × 2 night staff = $100k saved
- **Improved grant compliance** (track engagement, outcomes, demographics)
  - Better reporting → higher renewal rates, larger grants

**Pricing Model**:
- **Flat Annual Fee**: $25k-$75k/year (based on caregiver population served)
  - Includes: Unlimited caregivers, white-label branding, dashboard, reporting
- **Grant-Funded Pricing**: $50k/year (often covered by SSBG, OAA Title III grants)
- **Sliding Scale**: Discount for smaller CBOs (<$1M budget)

#### Long-Term Care & Senior Living

**Target Profiles**:
- Assisted living facilities (50-200 residents)
- Skilled nursing facilities (100-300 beds)
- Memory care communities (Alzheimer's, dementia units)
- Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs)

**Decision Makers**:
- Administrator (resident satisfaction, staff efficiency)
- Director of Nursing (family communication)
- Sales/Marketing Director (differentiation from competitors)

**Pain Points**:
1. **Constant Family Calls**: "How's mom today?" asked 5-10x/day per resident
   - Staff time: 10 min/call × 10 calls/day × 100 residents = 167 hours/day
2. **Anxious Families**: Especially after move-in (first 30 days)
   - High anxiety → poor reviews, resident pull-out
3. **Communication Gaps**: Families feel "out of the loop" between visits
   - Impact: Lower satisfaction scores, negative Yelp reviews
4. **Staff Burnout**: Nurses answering same questions instead of clinical care

**GiveCare Solution**:
- **Family Communication Hub**: Facility sends daily updates via GiveCare SMS
  - "Good morning! Your mom had a great breakfast and is now in art class."
- **On-Demand Q&A**: Family texts questions, AI answers or escalates to staff
  - "What medications is dad taking?" → AI retrieves from EHR integration
- **Transition Support**: Extra check-ins first 30 days after move-in
  - "How are you feeling about mom's transition? Any concerns?"
- **Crisis Alerts**: If family reports distress, escalate to administrator
  - "Family is upset about fall incident. Needs call from director today."

**Value Proposition**:
- **40-60% reduction in family phone calls** to staff
  - 100 residents × 10 calls/day = 1,000 calls/day
  - 50% reduction = 500 calls saved × 10 min = 83 hours/day × $20/hour = **$1,660/day**
  - **Annual savings**: $606k/year in staff time
- **Improved family satisfaction** (+20-30 NPS points)
  - Better reviews → higher occupancy (+5-10%) → +$500k revenue/year
- **Faster move-in conversions** (families feel reassured)
  - Sales cycle: 45 days → 30 days (15 days faster)

**Pricing Model**:
- **Per Bed Per Month**: $10-20/bed (regardless of occupancy)
  - Example: 100 beds × $15 = $1,500/month ($18k/year)
- **Per Family Per Month**: $8-12/active family
  - Example: 80 families × $10 = $800/month ($9.6k/year)
- **Recommended**: Per-bed pricing (simpler, predictable for budgeting)

**Sales Cycle**: 3-6 months (facility planning, family trial, staff training)

**Contract Size**: $10k-$50k/year (50-200 beds)

---

#### Hospitals & Health Systems

**Target Profiles**:
- Academic medical centers (teaching hospitals)
- Community hospitals (200+ beds)
- Hospital systems (3+ facilities)
- Cancer centers, cardiac institutes (high caregiver burden specialties)

**Decision Makers**:
- Chief Medical Officer (readmission reduction)
- VP Care Transitions (post-discharge programs)
- VP Patient Experience (HCAHPS scores)
- Population Health Director (risk contracts, ACO performance)

**Pain Points**:
1. **30-Day Readmissions**: Medicare penalties up to 3% of reimbursements
   - Penalty: $1-5M/year for large hospitals
2. **Caregiver Confusion Post-Discharge**: "What do I do with these 10 medications?"
   - Result: Medication errors → patient decline → readmission
3. **Teach-Back Failure**: Family says "I understand" but doesn't (literacy, stress)
   - Result: Poor care at home → complications
4. **Care Team Overload**: Care coordinators can't call every caregiver daily
   - Reality: 1 coordinator manages 100+ discharges/month

**GiveCare Solution**:
- **Post-Discharge Caregiver Coaching**: 30-day SMS program
  - Day 1: "Your dad was discharged today. Here's what to watch for in the next 24 hours."
  - Day 3: "Have you scheduled the follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith?"
  - Day 7: "Any new symptoms? Swelling, pain, confusion?"
- **Medication Reconciliation**: Daily reminders + teach-back quizzes
  - "What time should you give the blood thinner?" (interactive assessment)
- **Red Flag Detection**: AI detects concerning responses → alerts care team
  - Caregiver: "He's been confused and won't eat." → Escalate to nurse navigator
- **Care Plan Reinforcement**: Repeat key instructions from discharge summary
  - "Remember: weigh your mom every morning. Call doctor if weight increases 3+ lbs."

**Value Proposition**:
- **20-30% reduction in 30-day readmissions** (focus on caregiver-sensitive conditions)
  - Hospital: 500 discharges/month, 15% readmit rate = 75 readmissions
  - 25% reduction = 19 fewer readmissions × $20k = **$380k/month saved** ($4.5M/year)
- **Avoided CMS penalties** ($1-5M/year)
  - If hospital is at penalty threshold, 10% readmission improvement = penalty avoided
- **Improved HCAHPS scores** (family caregiver satisfaction)
  - +5-10 points on "transition rating" → +$500k value-based bonus

**Pricing Model**:
- **Per Discharge**: $50-100/discharge (only pay for caregivers enrolled)
  - Example: 500 discharges/month × $75 = $37.5k/month ($450k/year)
- **Per Bed Per Month**: $200-400/bed
  - Example: 200 beds × $300 = $60k/month ($720k/year)
- **Recommended**: Per-discharge pricing (aligns with value, easier ROI)

**Sales Cycle**: 12-18 months (clinical validation, IRB approval, integration)

**Contract Size**: $300k-$1M/year (200-500 beds)

  - After: 1 volunteer supports 100 families (AI handles routine)
- **24/7 support** without hiring staff
- **Better outcomes** (immediate support vs "call back during business hours")

---

## Part 3: D2C Accessibility Strategy

**Mission Commitment**: "No caregiver left behind due to cost"

### 3.1 Revised D2C Pricing (Accessible)

**Goal**: Offer D2C option for caregivers whose employers/health plans don't offer GiveCare, while maintaining affordability.

**Tiered D2C Pricing**:

**Free Tier** (Limited Access):

- 50 messages/month
- 2 assessments (EMA, CWBS)
- Basic crisis support (crisis agent available)
- **Target**: Low-income caregivers, Medicaid recipients

---

### 3.2 D2C as Enterprise Funnel

**Strategy**: D2C users become enterprise advocates

**Workflow**:
1. Caregiver signs up for D2C ($9.99/month)
2. After 30 days, GiveCare prompts: "Does your employer offer caregiver benefits?"
3. If "No", GiveCare provides: "Would you like us to contact your HR department?"
4. Sales team reaches out to employer: "You have 5 employees using GiveCare. We can offer this free to all employees for $X/year."

**Conversion Metrics**:
- 20% of D2C users work for mid-large employers (1k+ employees)
- 10% opt-in to "contact my employer"
- 30% of employer outreach converts to enterprise deal

**Example**:
- 1,000 D2C users → 200 at target employers → 20 employer leads → 6 enterprise deals @ $100k/year = $600k ARR

**Incentive**: D2C users get free upgrade if their employer adopts GiveCare

   - Average contract: $500k-$2M/year (vs $50k-$200k for employers)
   - Land-and-expand: Start with 1 hospital, expand to network

2. ✅ **Prove Clinical Outcomes**:
   - Publish pilot results: "20% readmission reduction in 90-day pilot"
   - Submit abstracts to conferences: AcademyHealth, American Geriatrics Society
   - Partner with academic medical center for peer-reviewed study

3. ✅ **Build Channel Partnerships**:
   - Benefits brokers (employer channel)
   - Medicare brokers (health plan channel)
   - Caregiver advocacy orgs (awareness + enterprise leads)

---

## Part 9: Medicare Reimbursement Strategy

**Strategic Insight**: GiveCare caregiver support services can **support** billing under **three existing Medicare codes**, creating indirect value for providers and potential direct revenue in provider-integrated models.

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE NOTICE**:
- GiveCare cannot directly bill Medicare codes unless operating as or under a Medicare billing provider
- All codes require "incident to" supervision by a billing practitioner (physician, NP, PA)
- Initiating visit by practitioner required before CHI/PIN services begin
- Time tracking, documentation, and MAC-specific rules must be followed
- This strategy requires **provider partnership models**, not standalone SaaS billing

---

---

### 9.2 Reimbursement-Enabled Value Propositions (Provider-Integrated Model)

#### For Hospitals & Health Systems

**Before GiveCare (Lost Revenue)**:
- Hospital discharges 500 patients/month
- Eligible for TCM billing (post-discharge caregivers)
- **Reality**: Care coordinators can't contact all caregivers → miss 70% of TCM billing opportunities
- **Lost revenue**: 500 × 70% × $201 (99495) = $70,350/month = **$844k/year lost**

**With GiveCare (Supported Revenue)**:
- GiveCare SMS automatically contacts 100% of caregivers within 2 business days (supports TCM requirement)
- 30-day post-discharge SMS program **documents** care coordination time for billing
- Care coordinators focus on face-to-face visits (required for TCM), GiveCare handles digital communication
- **Captured TCM revenue**: 500 × 80% success × $201 = $80,400/month = **$964k/year**
- **GiveCare cost**: 500 × $75/discharge = $37.5k/month ($450k/year)
- **Net gain**: $964k - $450k = **$514k/year profit** (plus readmission savings)

**COMPLIANCE NOTE**:
- Hospital billing provider must complete face-to-face visit (within 7-14 days)
- GiveCare provides **documentation support** for TCM billing, not billing itself
- Care coordinator must review GiveCare interaction logs and sign off on billing

**Revised Hospital ROI**:
- **Before**: $4.5M readmission savings - $450k GiveCare cost = $4M net benefit
- **After**: $4.5M readmission savings + $514k TCM profit = **$5M net benefit** (via improved billing capture)

---

#### For Health Plans (Medicare Advantage)

**Before GiveCare (Lost Revenue)**:
- Health plan has 100,000 members, 5% are family caregivers (5,000 caregivers)
- Patients with chronic conditions eligible for PIN codes (G0023, G0024)
- **Reality**: Care managers can't provide 60+ min/month navigation to all caregivers
- **Lost revenue**: 5,000 × 20% eligible × $90/month (G0023) = $90k/month = **$1.08M/year lost**

**With GiveCare (Supported Revenue - Hybrid Model)**:
- **Health plan hires certified navigators** (RNs, social workers, trained auxiliary personnel)
- Navigators use GiveCare platform to deliver PIN services (medication reminders, symptom monitoring, resource connection)
- Time tracking: GiveCare logs all navigator-initiated SMS conversations (count toward PIN 60 min/month requirement)
- Physician/practitioner must complete initiating visit and document need for PIN
- **Captured PIN revenue**: 5,000 × 50% engaged × $90/month = $225k/month = **$2.7M/year**
- **GiveCare cost**: 5,000 × $6/user = $30k/month ($360k/year)
- **Navigator cost**: 10 FTE × $75k/year = $750k/year (amortized across all services)
- **Net gain**: $2.7M - $360k - $150k (allocated navigator cost) = **$2.19M/year profit** (plus readmission savings)

**COMPLIANCE NOTE**:
- PIN services must be provided by **certified/trained auxiliary personnel** under "incident to" supervision
- GiveCare AI alone does NOT qualify - human navigator required
- Practitioner must complete initiating visit (E/M, TCM, AWV) before PIN services start
- Documented consent from patient/caregiver required

**Revised Health Plan ROI**:
- **Before**: $4M readmission savings - $360k GiveCare cost = $3.64M net benefit
- **After**: $4M readmission savings + $2.19M PIN profit = **$6.19M net benefit** (1.7x improvement via improved billing capture)

---

#### For FQHCs & RHCs (Community Health Centers)

**New Opportunity** (CHI Codes, effective 1/1/2025 - Hybrid Model):
- FQHC serves 10,000 patients, 30% have documented SDOH barriers (3,000 patients)
- Many are family caregivers managing care for others
- **Before**: No reimbursement for addressing SDOH (food insecurity, housing, transportation)
- **With GiveCare (Provider-Integrated Model)**:
  - **FQHC hires certified community health workers (CHWs)**
  - Practitioner completes initiating visit, documents SDOH barriers, creates treatment plan
  - CHWs use GiveCare platform to deliver CHI services (SDOH assessment + resource navigation)
  - GiveCare tracks time, documents activities, generates billing reports
  - 3,000 patients × 40% engage = 1,200 caregivers
  - 1,200 × $77.95 (G0019) = $93.5k/month = **$1.12M/year**
  - Many qualify for G0022 (additional 30 min): +$48.52 × 600 = $29k/month = **$350k/year**
  - **Total CHI revenue**: $1.47M/year
  - **GiveCare cost**: 1,200 × $5/user = $6k/month ($72k/year)
  - **CHW cost**: 5 FTE × $50k/year = $250k/year (amortized across all services)
  - **Net gain**: $1.47M - $72k - $50k (allocated CHW cost) = **$1.35M/year profit**

**COMPLIANCE NOTE**:
- CHI services must be provided by **certified/trained community health workers** under "incident to" supervision
- GiveCare AI alone does NOT qualify - human CHW required
- Practitioner must complete initiating visit (E/M, AWV, TCM) that documents unmet SDOH and treatment plan
- Only one provider may bill CHI per patient per month

**Positioning**: GiveCare enables CHI billing (revenue generator), plus improves patient outcomes (SDOH addressed = better chronic disease management)

---

### 9.3 Medicare Reimbursement Implementation Strategy

**CRITICAL: Provider Partnership Models Required**

All Medicare billing strategies require GiveCare to operate as a **platform for certified personnel** under provider supervision, not as a standalone AI billing entity. Three integration models:

**Model 1: Documentation Support Tool** (Lowest compliance risk)
- GiveCare provides time tracking, interaction logging, billing report generation
- Provider's existing staff (care coordinators, navigators, CHWs) use GiveCare as workflow tool
- Provider bills Medicare codes, GiveCare charges SaaS fee
- **No "incident to" issues** - provider staff remain primary caregivers

**Model 2: Staffing Partnership** (Medium compliance risk)
- GiveCare employs certified personnel (RNs, social workers, CHWs)
- GiveCare staff provide services "incident to" provider's supervision
- Provider bills Medicare codes, shares revenue with GiveCare
- **Requires**: Clinical oversight agreement, malpractice insurance, credentialing

**Model 3: Revenue Share Partnership** (Highest compliance risk)
- GiveCare provides platform + certified personnel
- Provider bills Medicare codes, pays GiveCare percentage of captured revenue
- **Requires**: Stark Law compliance, Anti-Kickback Statute review, legal counsel

**Recommendation**: Start with **Model 1** (documentation support tool) to minimize compliance risk, expand to Model 2/3 after legal review.

---

#### Phase 1: TCM Code Capture (Hospitals - Model 1)

**Target**: Hospitals with <50% TCM billing capture rate

**GiveCare Setup (Documentation Support Tool)**:
1. Integrate with hospital EHR (ADT feed for discharge events)
2. Automatically enroll discharged patients' caregivers via SMS
3. **Hospital care coordinator** initiates first contact within 2 business days (uses GiveCare platform)
4. Track all SMS conversations (time stamps, caregiver responses, care coordinator actions)
5. Generate TCM billing report: "Caregiver contacted on [date] by Care Coordinator Smith, 8 interactions over 30 days, total 45 min"
6. Care coordinator completes face-to-face visit (bills 99495 or 99496)
7. **Care coordinator reviews and signs off** on GiveCare-generated billing documentation

**Revenue Model**:
- **GiveCare SaaS pricing**: $50-75/discharge (documentation support tool)
- **Hospital captures TCM revenue**: $201-273/discharge (keeps 100%)
- **Net to hospital**: $126-223/discharge profit (TCM revenue minus GiveCare cost)
- **No revenue share** (avoids Stark/Anti-Kickback concerns)

---

#### Phase 2: PIN Code Capture (Health Plans, ACOs - Model 2)

**Target**: Medicare Advantage plans, ACOs managing high-risk populations

**GiveCare Setup (Staffing Partnership Model)**:
1. **Health plan hires certified navigators** (or contracts with GiveCare-employed navigators)
2. Practitioner completes initiating visit (E/M, TCM, AWV), identifies need for PIN services, documents consent
3. **Certified navigator** (RN, social worker, trained auxiliary personnel) uses GiveCare platform to deliver PIN services:
   - Medication adherence reminders (count toward 60 min/month)
   - Symptom monitoring ("Has mom's shortness of breath gotten worse?")
   - Resource connection (respite care, durable medical equipment)
4. Track time: Each navigator-initiated SMS conversation = 5-10 min (logged automatically by GiveCare)
5. GiveCare escalates high-risk alerts to supervising practitioner
6. Generate PIN billing report: "Navigator engaged caregiver 12 times, total 75 min, reviewed by Dr. Jones"
7. **Supervising practitioner reviews and signs off** on PIN billing

**Revenue Model (Staffing Partnership)**:
- **Health Plan Bills G0023**: $90/caregiver/month
- **GiveCare Platform Cost**: $6/caregiver/month (SaaS fee)
- **Navigator Cost**: $15/caregiver/month (if GiveCare-employed)
- **Net to Plan**: $69/caregiver/month ($828/year per caregiver)
- **Positioning**: "GiveCare provides platform + certified personnel, you bill Medicare codes"

**Alternative Model (Documentation Support Only)**:
- Health plan uses own navigators, GiveCare provides workflow tool
- **GiveCare Cost**: $6/caregiver/month
- **Net to Plan**: $84/caregiver/month ($1,008/year per caregiver)

---

#### Phase 3: CHI Code Capture (FQHCs, CBOs - Model 2)

**Target**: Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Clinics (new billing requirement 1/1/2025)

**GiveCare Setup (Staffing Partnership Model)**:
1. **FQHC hires certified community health workers (CHWs)** (or contracts with GiveCare-employed CHWs)
2. Practitioner completes initiating visit (E/M, AWV, TCM), documents unmet SDOH barriers, creates treatment plan
3. **Certified CHW** uses GiveCare platform to deliver CHI services:
   - SDOH screening: "Do you have trouble affording food? Safe housing? Transportation to appointments?"
   - Resource navigation: Connect to local food banks, housing assistance, Medicaid transport
   - Follow-up: "Did you visit the food bank? Did you apply for SNAP?"
4. Track time: GiveCare logs all CHW-initiated interactions (SDOH assessment 10 min + resource navigation 20 min + follow-up 30 min = 60 min/month)
5. Generate CHI billing report: "CHW screened patient for SDOH, 3 barriers identified, 65 min support provided, reviewed by Dr. Smith"
6. **Supervising practitioner reviews and signs off** on CHI billing

**Revenue Model (Staffing Partnership)**:
- **FQHC Bills G0019**: $77.95/patient/month
- **GiveCare Platform Cost**: $5/patient/month (SaaS fee)
- **CHW Cost**: $10/patient/month (if GiveCare-employed)
- **Net to FQHC**: $62.95/patient/month ($755/year per patient)
- **Positioning**: "GiveCare provides platform + certified CHWs, you bill Medicare codes"

**Alternative Model (Documentation Support Only)**:
- FQHC uses own CHWs, GiveCare provides workflow tool
- **GiveCare Cost**: $5/patient/month
- **Net to FQHC**: $72.95/patient/month ($875/year per patient)

- ✅ Minimum 60 minutes per calendar month (G0019)
- ✅ Minimum 90 minutes total before billing G0022 (additional 30 min)
- ✅ Services address specific SDOH barriers (food, housing, transportation, safety)

**GiveCare Auto-Generated Report**:
```
CHI Report - Patient: Carlos Garcia
SDOH Barriers: Food insecurity, transportation to appointments
Month: October 2025

✅ SDOH Screening (10 min):
   "Do you have trouble affording food for your family?"
   Response: "Yes, sometimes we skip meals to save money."

   "Do you have reliable transportation to medical appointments?"
   Response: "No, I had to cancel 2 appointments this month."

✅ Resource Navigation (35 min):
   - Connected to local food bank (SMS: address, hours, eligibility)
   - Applied for SNAP benefits (sent application link)
   - Referred to Medicaid non-emergency transport (enrollment SMS)

✅ Follow-Up (20 min):
   - Week 2: "Did you visit the food bank? How did it go?"
   - Week 3: "SNAP application submitted? Need help?"
   - Week 4: "Transportation set up for next appointment?"

✅ Total Time: 65 minutes (qualifies for G0019)

✅ Next Month: If continued support needed (30+ additional min), bill G0022
```

**Billing Recommendation**: G0019 (first 60 min)

### 9.5 Medicare Reimbursement Sales Messaging

#### Pitch to Hospitals (Documentation Support Model)

**Current Reality**:
- "You're discharging 500 patients/month but only billing TCM codes for 30% of them. That's $844k/year in lost revenue. Why? Your care coordinators can't manually contact and track all caregivers within 2 business days."

**With GiveCare (Documentation Support Tool)**:
- "GiveCare provides your care coordinators with a platform to automatically contact 100% of caregivers within 2 business days (meets TCM requirement), track all interactions (SMS timestamps, response tracking), and generate compliant billing documentation."
- "Your care coordinators remain the primary caregivers (no 'incident to' compliance issues), but GiveCare eliminates manual tracking and documentation burden."
- "You capture $964k/year in TCM codes (80% billing capture rate), pay us $375k/year ($50/discharge platform fee), and net $589k profit—plus $4.5M in readmission savings."

**ROI**: $5.1M total benefit (TCM revenue + readmission savings) for $375k investment = **13.6x ROI**

**Compliance Positioning**:
- "GiveCare is a documentation support tool, not a billing entity. Your staff remain primary caregivers, we just make their workflow more efficient and billable."

---

#### Pitch to Health Plans (Staffing Partnership Model)

**Current Reality**:
- "Your care managers can't provide 60+ minutes/month of principal illness navigation to 5,000 caregivers. You're missing $1.08M/year in PIN code revenue. Why? You don't have enough certified navigators, and manual tracking is too time-consuming."

**With GiveCare (Staffing Partnership)**:
- **Option A - You Hire Navigators, We Provide Platform**: "Hire certified navigators (RNs, social workers), they use GiveCare to deliver PIN services (medication reminders, symptom monitoring, resource connection). GiveCare tracks time, generates billing docs, escalates high-risk cases. You capture $2.7M/year in PIN codes, pay us $360k platform fee, and net $2.34M profit—plus $4M in readmission savings."
- **Option B - We Provide Navigators + Platform**: "GiveCare provides certified navigators + platform. We handle hiring, training, supervision. You pay $21/caregiver/month ($6 platform + $15 navigator), bill Medicare $90/caregiver/month (G0023), net $69/caregiver/month profit. You capture $4.14M/year in PIN codes (5,000 caregivers × 50% engaged × $69 profit), plus $4M readmission savings."

**ROI (Option A)**: $6.34M total benefit for $360k investment = **17.6x ROI**
**ROI (Option B)**: $8.14M total benefit for $1.26M investment = **6.5x ROI** (higher cost, but zero staffing burden)

**Compliance Positioning**:
- "Our navigators work 'incident to' your supervising practitioners. Initiating visit by your MD/NP/PA required before PIN services start. We handle credentialing, training, and supervision documentation."

---

#### Pitch to FQHCs (Staffing Partnership Model)

**Current Reality**:
- "You have 3,000 patients with SDOH barriers but no reimbursement for addressing them. New CMS rule (1/1/2025) requires billing CHI codes individually (G0019/G0022). But you don't have enough certified CHWs, and manual SDOH tracking is impossible to bill."

**With GiveCare (Staffing Partnership)**:
- **Option A - You Hire CHWs, We Provide Platform**: "Hire certified community health workers, they use GiveCare to deliver CHI services (SDOH screening, resource navigation, follow-up). GiveCare tracks time (60+ min/month requirement), generates billing docs. You capture $1.47M/year in CHI codes, pay us $72k platform fee, allocate $250k CHW cost (5 FTE), and net $1.15M profit."
- **Option B - We Provide CHWs + Platform**: "GiveCare provides certified CHWs + platform. We handle hiring, training, supervision. You pay $15/patient/month ($5 platform + $10 CHW), bill Medicare $77.95/patient/month (G0019), net $62.95/patient/month profit. You capture $907k/year in CHI codes (1,200 patients × $62.95 profit)."

**ROI (Option A)**: $1.15M profit for $322k investment = **3.6x ROI**
**ROI (Option B)**: $907k profit for $216k investment = **4.2x ROI** (zero staffing burden)

**Compliance Positioning**:
- "Our CHWs work 'incident to' your practitioners. Initiating visit by your MD/NP/PA required, must document unmet SDOH and treatment plan. We handle CHW certification, training, and supervision documentation."

**Urgency Hook**:
- "CMS compliance deadline is 9/30/2025. If you're not billing G0019/G0022 individually by then, you're non-compliant AND leaving $1M+ on the table."

### 9.6 Strategic Recommendations

**Immediate Actions** (Next 90 Days):

1. ✅ **Obtain Legal/Compliance Review** (CRITICAL FIRST STEP):
   - Engage healthcare attorney to review provider partnership models (Model 1 vs Model 2 vs Model 3)
   - Review Stark Law, Anti-Kickback Statute, "incident to" billing rules
   - Draft clinical oversight agreements for staffing partnership model
   - Review malpractice insurance requirements for GiveCare-employed personnel
   - **Decision**: Which model to pursue first (Recommendation: Model 1 - documentation support tool)

2. ✅ **Build Medicare Billing Documentation Features** (Model 1):
   - Auto-generate TCM/PIN/CHI reports (time tracking, interaction summaries, billing recommendations)
   - **Compliance checkboxes**: "Initiating visit completed? Y/N", "Supervising practitioner reviewed? Y/N"
   - **Time tracking**: Log all interactions with timestamps, calculate total minutes per calendar month
   - **Billing recommendations**: "Qualifies for G0019 (65 min documented)" or "Does not qualify (only 45 min, need 60 min)"
   - Integrate with hospital/health plan billing systems (HL7 FHIR, EDI 837 claims)
   - Compliance dashboard: "You have 50 caregivers eligible for PIN codes this month"

3. ✅ **Update Sales Collateral** (Compliance-Focused):
   - Add "Medicare Reimbursement ROI" section to all pitch decks
   - **Compliance disclaimer**: "GiveCare is a documentation support tool. All Medicare billing must be performed by qualified providers under 'incident to' supervision. ROI estimates assume provider compliance with CMS billing rules."
   - TCM calculator: "Enter discharges/month → See lost revenue vs GiveCare-supported capture"
   - PIN calculator: "Enter caregiver population → See missed billing vs captured revenue (with certified navigators)"
   - **Positioning**: "GiveCare enables billing compliance, we don't bill Medicare directly"

4. ✅ **Pilot Program Strategy** (Documentation Support Model):
   - Hospitals: Pilot with 100 discharges, track TCM capture rate (before: 30% → after: 80%)
     - **Compliance measure**: "% of TCM bills with complete GiveCare documentation (target: 100%)"
   - Health Plans: Pilot with 500 caregivers using plan's existing navigators + GiveCare platform
     - Track PIN billing (before: $0 → after: $540k/year with GiveCare time tracking)
   - FQHCs: Pilot with 200 patients using FQHC's existing CHWs + GiveCare platform
     - Track CHI billing (before: $0 → after: $187k/year with GiveCare documentation)

5. ✅ **Hire Reimbursement Consultant** (or partner):
   - Expert in Medicare billing (TCM, PIN, CHI codes)
   - Helps clients navigate compliance, documentation, MAC-specific rules, appeals
   - **Critical role**: Review all GiveCare-generated billing documentation for CMS compliance before client submits claims
   - Value-add: "We don't just provide the platform, we help you maximize compliant reimbursement"

6. ✅ **Decision: Staffing Partnership Model** (Model 2 - Future Phase):
   - If legal review approves, consider hiring certified personnel (RNs, social workers, CHWs)
   - **Requires**: State licensure, credentialing, malpractice insurance ($2M/occurrence minimum)
   - **Revenue model**: Charge clients for platform + personnel ($15-21/patient/month vs $5-6 platform only)
   - **Timeline**: 6-12 months after Model 1 launch (legal complexity)

### 9.7 Compliance Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE RISKS**:

1. ⚠️ **False Claims Act** (31 U.S.C. § 3729-3733)
   - **Risk**: Billing Medicare for AI-only services without qualified human supervision
   - **Penalty**: $11,000-$22,000 per false claim + treble damages + exclusion from Medicare
   - **Mitigation**: Model 1 (documentation support) ONLY until legal review completed

2. ⚠️ **Stark Law** (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn)
   - **Risk**: Revenue share arrangements may constitute illegal referral compensation
   - **Penalty**: $15,000-$100,000 per violation + refund of payments
   - **Mitigation**: Avoid revenue share model (Model 3) unless Stark exception applies (e.g., bona fide employment, fair market value)

3. ⚠️ **Anti-Kickback Statute** (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b))
   - **Risk**: Payments to GiveCare for "captured revenue" may be viewed as kickbacks for referrals
   - **Penalty**: $25,000 per violation + 5 years imprisonment + exclusion from Medicare
   - **Mitigation**: Model 1 (fixed SaaS fee unrelated to Medicare billings) or Model 2 (bona fide employment of certified personnel)

4. ⚠️ **"Incident To" Billing Rules** (42 C.F.R. § 410.26)
   - **Risk**: GiveCare AI services may not qualify as "incident to" if no qualified human supervision
   - **Penalty**: Medicare denials, recoupment of payments, program integrity audit
   - **Mitigation**: Certified personnel (RN, social worker, CHW) must deliver services, not AI alone

5. ⚠️ **State Licensure Requirements**
   - **Risk**: Providing navigation/care management services without appropriate state licenses
   - **Penalty**: State medical board sanctions, cease and desist orders
   - **Mitigation**: If hiring personnel (Model 2), ensure state-specific licensure (e.g., RN license in state where patient resides)

**Recommendation**: **Do NOT bill Medicare codes until legal counsel confirms compliance**. Start with Model 1 (documentation support tool) as safest entry point.

### 9.8 Alternative Reimbursement Pathways (Non-Medicare)

If Medicare billing proves too complex/risky, consider these alternative value-capture models:

**Medicaid (State-Specific)**:
- Some states reimburse CHWs, peer support, community paramedicine
- State plan amendments (SPAs) or 1115 waivers may cover caregiver support services
- **Example**: Oregon Medicaid reimburses traditional health workers (THW) for caregiver navigation

**Commercial Payers**:
- Vertical integration: Health plans may pay GiveCare directly (not via claims)
- Value-based contracts: Shared savings on avoided readmissions (no fee-for-service billing)
- **Example**: Humana pays digital health vendors for engagement metrics, not claims

**Employer Direct Contracting**:
- Employers pay GiveCare directly as employee benefit (no insurance billing)
- **Example**: Amazon, Walmart self-fund caregiver support programs

**Grant Funding** (for CBOs, FQHCs):
- Administration for Community Living (ACL) - National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP)
- HRSA grants for SDOH initiatives
- **Example**: FQHC uses HRSA grant to fund GiveCare platform, avoids Medicare billing complexity

---

**Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate**: Obtain legal review of provider partnership models (estimated cost: $15k-$30k for healthcare attorney)
2. **Week 2**: Build Model 1 (documentation support tool) features - NO direct billing claims
3. **Week 4**: Pilot with 1 hospital using Model 1 (their staff, our platform) - measure TCM capture rate improvement
4. **Month 3**: If Model 1 successful + legal review approves, explore Model 2 (staffing partnership)
5. **Month 6**: Decide whether Medicare billing complexity is worth ROI vs alternative models (Medicaid, commercial, employer direct)

**Question for leadership**: Which model do you want to pursue first? Recommendation: **Model 1** (documentation support tool) - lowest risk, fastest time to market, no legal/compliance hurdles.
