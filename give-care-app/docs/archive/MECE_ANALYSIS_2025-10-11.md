## üîç MECE VIOLATIONS FOUND

### 1. TAXONOMY.md + TAXONOMY_VISUAL.md (Duplication)

**Issue:** Same content in two formats
- `TAXONOMY.md` - Text-based reference (20 KB)
- `TAXONOMY_VISUAL.md` - Visual diagrams (33 KB)

**Why it violates MECE:**
- ‚ùå **Not Mutually Exclusive:** Both cover nomenclature (bands, zones, phases)
- ‚úÖ **Collectively Exhaustive:** Both together cover all nomenclature

**Impact:** Developers must check both files, risk of inconsistency

**Recommendation:** **Merge into ONE file**
```
TAXONOMY.md (combined - ~40 KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 1: Text Reference (tables, definitions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 2: Visual Diagrams (ASCII art, flowcharts)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Section 3: Quick Reference (cheat sheet)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth
- ‚úÖ No risk of inconsistency
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain
- ‚úÖ One file to search

---

### 2. SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md + ARCHITECTURE.md (Minor Overlap)

**Issue:** Both describe system components

- `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` (17 KB) - Product walkthrough (user-facing perspective)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (16 KB) - System design (technical perspective)

**Overlap:**
- Both mention 3-agent system
- Both describe assessments
- Both explain user journey

**Why it's acceptable:**
- ‚úÖ **Different audiences:** Product (non-technical) vs Engineering (technical)
- ‚úÖ **Different perspectives:** What vs How
- ‚úÖ **Different depth:** Overview vs Deep dive

**Verdict:** **MECE compliant** (different purposes, minimal overlap is acceptable)

**Recommendation:** Keep both, but clarify audience in each doc's header:
- `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` ‚Üí "**Audience:** Product, non-technical stakeholders"
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Üí "**Audience:** Engineers, technical stakeholders"

---

### 3. TASKS.md (Temporal Issue)

**Issue:** May contain completed tasks mixed with active tasks

**Why it violates MECE:**
- ‚ùå **Not Mutually Exclusive:** Completed vs active tasks in same file
- ‚ùå **Not Collectively Exhaustive:** Missing archival process

**Recommendation:** **Prune regularly**
- Keep only active sprint items
- Move completed sprints to `docs/archive/`
- Create `docs/archive/tasks-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for completed work

---

## ‚úÖ MECE COMPLIANT DOCS (12 out of 15)

These docs have **zero overlap** and cover **unique domains**:

1. CLAUDE.md (navigation)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (technical design)
3. ASSESSMENTS.md (clinical domain)
4. DEVELOPMENT.md (dev workflow)
5. DEPLOYMENT.md (production deploy)
6. SCHEDULING.md (proactive messaging)
7. RATE_LIMITS.md (rate limiting)
8. SOP.md (troubleshooting)
9. CHANGELOG.md (version history)
10. ADMIN_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md (dashboard ops)
11. STRIPE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md (payments)
12. SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md (product overview - acceptable minor overlap)

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULL MECE COMPLIANCE

### Priority 1: Merge TAXONOMY docs (HIGH)

**Action:**
```bash
# 1. Merge TAXONOMY_VISUAL.md into TAXONOMY.md
# 2. Delete TAXONOMY_VISUAL.md
# 3. Update CLAUDE.md index to remove TAXONOMY_VISUAL reference
```

**New TAXONOMY.md structure:**
```markdown
# GiveCare Taxonomy Reference

## Part 1: Text Reference
- Bands (0-100 scores)
- Zones (pressure zones)
- Phases (journey phases)
- Tiers (service tiers)
- Formatting rules

## Part 2: Visual Diagrams
- Band thresholds (ASCII table)
- Zone mapping (flowchart)
- Phase progression (diagram)
- Tier hierarchy (visual)

## Part 3: Quick Reference
- Cheat sheet
- Common patterns
- Examples
```

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Priority 2: Clarify Audience (MEDIUM)

**Action:** Add audience headers to overlapping docs

**SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md:**
```markdown
# GiveCare System Overview

**Audience:** Product managers, non-technical stakeholders, investors
**Purpose:** Understand what the product does and how users interact with it
**Technical Depth:** Low (no code)

---
[Rest of content]
```

**ARCHITECTURE.md:**
```markdown
# GiveCare Architecture

**Audience:** Engineers, technical stakeholders, AI developers
**Purpose:** Understand system design, data flows, and implementation details
**Technical Depth:** High (includes code patterns)

---
[Rest of content]
```

**Time:** 5 minutes

---

### Priority 3: Prune TASKS.md (LOW - Ongoing)

**Action:** Review and archive completed tasks

```bash
# 1. Read TASKS.md
# 2. Identify completed sections
# 3. Move to docs/archive/tasks-2025-10-11.md
# 4. Keep only active sprint items in TASKS.md
```

**Time:** 15 minutes (recurring monthly)
