### Admin Dashboard Docs (CONSOLIDATE - 5 files → 1)

| File | Size | Purpose | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **ADMIN_BUILD_STATUS.md** | 8.8 KB | Build progress tracker | 🗑️ Archive (completed) |
| **ADMIN_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md** | 10.0 KB | Complete setup guide | 🔄 Merge into ADMIN_READY.md |

**Recommendation:** Create **ONE** file: `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md`

**Contents:**
- Current deployment URL
- Tech stack overview
- How to update/redeploy
- Common operations
- Troubleshooting

**Archive the rest** (planning/build docs are historical)

### Cloudflare Deployment (CONSOLIDATE - 1 file)

| File | Size | Purpose | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_SETUP.md** | 17.1 KB | Cloudflare Pages deployment | 🔄 Merge into DEPLOYMENT.md |

**Recommendation:** Add Cloudflare Pages section to DEPLOYMENT.md, then delete this file.

### Business Strategy Docs (MOVE TO SEPARATE FOLDER - 4 files)

| File | Size | Purpose | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **ENTERPRISE_GTM_STRATEGY.md** | 67.2 KB | Enterprise go-to-market | 📁 Move to `docs/business/` |

**Why?** Keeps `docs/` focused on technical/product documentation.

## 🎯 CLEANUP PLAN

### Phase 1: Create New Folder Structure
```
docs/
├── business/              ← NEW: Business strategy docs
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── ENTERPRISE_GTM_STRATEGY.md
│   ├── MEDICARE_REIMBURSEMENT_ROADMAP.md
│   ├── PRICING_COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md
│   └── PRICING.md
├── internal/              ← NEW: Internal tooling
│   └── DASHBOARDS_AND_EVALS.md
└── archive/
    ├── stripe-setup-2025-10-11/
    └── admin-dashboard-2025-10-11/  ← NEW
```

### Phase 2: Consolidate Admin Dashboard Docs

**Create:** `docs/ADMIN_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` (single source of truth)

**Include:**
- Deployment URL: https://dash.givecareapp.com
- Tech stack: Next.js 15 + Convex + shadcn/ui
- Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Environment variables
- Redeployment process
- Common operations
- Troubleshooting

**Archive:** Move these to `docs/archive/admin-dashboard-2025-10-11/`:
- ADMIN_BUILD_STATUS.md (historical)
- ADMIN_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md (superseded)
- ADMIN_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md (planning doc)
- ADMIN_SETUP.md (superseded)

**Keep:** ADMIN_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md (new consolidated doc)

### Phase 3: Merge Cloudflare into Deployment

**Update:** `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Add section:**
```markdown
## Admin Dashboard Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

The admin dashboard is deployed separately on Cloudflare Pages.

### Deployment URL
https://dash.givecareapp.com

### Setup
[Content from CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_SETUP.md]
```

**Delete:** CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_SETUP.md

### Phase 4: Move Business Docs

**Create:** `docs/business/README.md`
```markdown
# Business Strategy Documents

These documents contain business strategy, go-to-market planning, and
pricing analysis. They are NOT technical documentation.

**For engineering docs, see parent `docs/` folder.**
```

**Move:**
- ENTERPRISE_GTM_STRATEGY.md → `docs/business/`
- MEDICARE_REIMBURSEMENT_ROADMAP.md → `docs/business/`
- PRICING_COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md → `docs/business/`
- PRICING.md → `docs/business/`

### Phase 5: Move Internal Tooling

**Create:** `docs/internal/`

**Move:**
- DASHBOARDS_AND_EVALS.md → `docs/internal/`

### Phase 6: Review & Prune TASKS.md

**Action items:**
- Read through TASKS.md
- Mark completed items
- Archive completed sections to `docs/archive/`
- Keep only active sprint items

## 📝 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority
1. **High:** Consolidate admin dashboard docs (5 files → 1)
2. **High:** Move business docs to separate folder (reduce confusion)
3. **Medium:** Merge Cloudflare into deployment guide
4. **Medium:** Move internal tooling docs
5. **Low:** Prune TASKS.md (ongoing maintenance)

### Timing
- **Phase 1-4:** 30 minutes (folder creation + file moves)
- **Phase 5:** 15 minutes (merge Cloudflare content)
- **Phase 6:** 15 minutes (review TASKS.md)
- **Total:** ~1 hour

### Benefits
- ✅ Cleaner navigation for engineers
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers

## ❓ QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

1. **TASKS.md:** Should we archive completed tasks or keep them for reference?
   - **Recommendation:** Archive completed sprints, keep only active work

2. **ADMIN_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md:** Should it live in `docs/` or `admin-frontend/`?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep in `docs/` for visibility (it's deployed separately)

3. **Business docs:** Should they stay in this repo or move to separate business-docs repo?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep in this repo but in `docs/business/` subfolder
