## 🎯 **YOUR PRICING STRATEGY**

### Phase 1: Raise to $9.99/month (Immediate - 30 Day Notice)
- **Current:** $7.99/month
- **New:** $9.99/month (+25% increase)
- **Annual:** $99/year ($8.25/month, 17% savings)
- **Rationale:** Still 23% cheaper than competitors (Wysa $12.99), maintains affordability
- **Expected Impact:** <10% churn, +18% revenue

### Phase 2: Consider $14.99/month (6 Months Later, A/B Test)
- **Standard:** $14.99/month ($149/year)
- **Premium:** $19.99/month ($199/year) with priority features
- **Rationale:** Matches market rate (Replika $15-20), reflects clinical value
- **Expected Impact:** 10-20% churn, +50-70% revenue

## 🤝 **PARTNER REFERRAL PROGRAM** (Simplified)

**Purpose:** Track signups from partner orgs, offer nominal discount

### Your Two Partners

| Org | Code | Discount | Duration | Purpose | Stripe ID |
|-----|------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **401C** | `PARTNER-401C` | $2 off/month | 3 months | Startup partner referrals | `pdu3yiPI` |
| **Stork** | `PARTNER-STORK` | $2 off/month | 3 months | Startup partner referrals | `zuRTG1Y9` |

**How It Works:**
1. Partner shares signup link: `givecareapp.com/signup?code=PARTNER-401C`
2. User enters code at checkout (or auto-applied via URL)
3. User pays $7.99 for 3 months (instead of $9.99)
4. After 3 months, price reverts to $9.99
5. **You track signups via Stripe metadata** (no commission payments)

**Benefits:**
- **For You:** Track which partner is driving signups, build case studies
- **For Partners:** Can tell their community "Get 20% off for 3 months with our code"
- **For Users:** Small discount incentive to try GiveCare

## 💙 **CAREGIVER AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM**

**Purpose:** "No caregiver left behind due to cost"

### Affordability Codes (Honor System, No Verification)

| **STUDENT** | $5 off/month | 12 months | **$4.99/month** | College students | `YQddQd0S` |

**How Users Get Codes:**

2. **Option B:** Contact support: "I can't afford $9.99" → We send code
3. **Option C:** See affordability link on pricing page

**No Income Verification:**

## 📞 **SUPPORT SCRIPTS FOR YOUR TEAM**

### Script 1: "I can't afford $9.99"
```
"I understand. We never want price to be a barrier. We have
financial assistance codes available. What's your situation?"

→ General hardship: CAREGIVER50 ($4.99/month)
→ Medicaid/SNAP: MEDICAID ($0.99/month)
→ Military: VETERAN ($4.99/month)
→ Student: STUDENT ($4.99/month)

"Just enter code [CODE] at checkout. No verification needed."
```

### Script 2: "Why did the price increase?"
```
"We've added 3 new clinical assessments, 24/7 crisis support,
and proactive wellness check-ins since launch. The new price
reflects this enhanced value while remaining 95% cheaper than
therapy ($260-400/month).

If you're an existing user, you keep your current $7.99 price
for the next 12 months as a thank you for your loyalty."
```

### Script 3: Partner asks "How do I share my code?"
```
"Share this link with your community:
givecareapp.com/signup?code=PARTNER-401C

Or tell them to enter code PARTNER-401C at checkout for $2 off
per month for 3 months. We'll send you a quarterly report showing
how many signups came from your code."
