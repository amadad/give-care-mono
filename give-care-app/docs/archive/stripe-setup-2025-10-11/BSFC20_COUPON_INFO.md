## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE**

Stripe auto-generated the ID `TRZM47tU` instead of using "BSFC20" as the code.

### **Option 1: Users Enter This Code at Checkout**
Tell users to enter: **`TRZM47tU`**
- ‚ùå Not user-friendly (random ID)
- ‚ùå Hard to remember

### **Option 2: Create New Coupon with Proper Code (RECOMMENDED)**

We need to delete `TRZM47tU` and create a new one with code "BSFC20".

**However**, Stripe API has a quirk:
- When creating via API with `id` parameter, sometimes it doesn't work
- **Better to create via Stripe Dashboard** for custom codes

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED FIX: CREATE VIA DASHBOARD**

### **Steps:**

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons

2. **Click:** "+ Create coupon"

3. **Fill in:**
   - **Coupon ID:** `BSFC20` (custom code)
   - **Name:** BSFC20 - Burnout Self-Check Completion
   - **Type:** Amount off
   - **Amount off:** $2.00 USD
   - **Duration:** Once
   - **Max redemptions:** Leave blank (unlimited)

4. **Metadata (optional but recommended):**
   - Key: `category` | Value: `assessment_reward`
   - Key: `description` | Value: `20% off for completing Burnout Self-Check`

5. **Click:** "Create coupon"

### **Then Delete the Old One:**

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons
2. Find coupon ID `TRZM47tU`
3. Click **‚ãØ** menu ‚Üí Delete
4. Confirm deletion

---

## üí° **ALTERNATIVE: KEEP CURRENT & TELL USERS DIFFERENT CODE**

If you want to skip the dashboard work, you can:
1. Keep coupon ID `TRZM47tU`
2. Tell users: "Use code **TRZM47tU** at checkout"
3. Update your website to show this code

**But this is NOT recommended** because:
- ‚ùå Code is not memorable
- ‚ùå Looks unprofessional
- ‚ùå Doesn't match your branding (BSFC20)

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

**Just create it via Stripe Dashboard manually:**

It takes 2 minutes and gives you the exact code you want: **BSFC20**

Then users can:
1. Complete Burnout Self-Check on your website
2. See: "Use code **BSFC20** for 20% off your first month!"
3. Enter **BSFC20** at Stripe checkout
4. Get $2 off ‚Üí Pay $7.99 instead of $9.99
