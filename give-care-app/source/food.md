Gleaners Kitchen

The Gleaners Community Kitchen opened in February of 1987 with a mission: to serve healthy meals, free of charge, to those in need, no questions asked, no one denied. Since serving just three meals on that first day we have grown tremendously. We now serve about 70 meals each day, more than 18,000 annually! With the generous support of local grocery stores, restaurants, service organizations and individuals, we will continue to provide meals for many years to come.

What is Gleaning?

In ancient times, “gleaning” was the act of collecting crops leftover from famers’ fields after they had been commercially harvested, and some cultures promoted gleaning as an early form of welfare.

However, in modern times, gleaning is accomplished by collecting food from supermarkets that would otherwise be thrown away. This food can then be prepared and served, or given away, to those who need it.

Bargain Grocery - Affordable Food

Bargain Grocery Location - 1110 Lincoln Ave, Utica NY 13502

We are tackling both food waste and food insecurity in our own community. Roughly 40% of the food in the United States is not eaten. Nearly 1 in 8 Americans do not have consistent access to food. As of 2016, 12.% of Oneida County residents were food insecure — that is 28,440 people who do not have consistent access to enough food, or quality food for a healthy life.

Bargain Grocery is a local grocery store dedicated to serving the community. We were founded in 2002 to generate funds for Compassion Coalition, a nonprofit organization that donates items back into the community. Our store offers fresh, healthy food at an exceptionally affordable price, creating food access and diverting food waste.

Our store offers fresh, healthy food at an exceptionally affordable price, creating food access and diverting food waste.

We sell produce, dairy, meat, non-perishables, frozen items, fresh meals prepared by a chef in our in-store kitchen, and more. Follow us on Facebook for updates on what is in stock — every trip to our store is an exciting adventure, since we never know what new items we may get.

Bargain Grocery partners with national and local vendors to buy food that was overproduced, and receives donated products from companies, then sells this product at a low price. Our prices are typically much lower than big box stores, and because of our unique model, we never know exactly what items we’ll receive, making our store a great place to explore new foods.

By shopping at Bargain Grocery, you are working to not only combat food waste but also to help your own community, our low prices enable community members to access fresh, healthy food at an affordable price, in a dignified, independent manner, and have been shown to increase the buying power of EBT by over 30%. Proceeds from the store have allowed Compassion Coalition to give more than $20 million in donated goods each year, and serve more than 350,000 individuals in our community and across New York state annually.
