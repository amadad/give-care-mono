## SLIDE 1: TITLE

**Invisible Care, Visible Health**
Reframing Family Caregiving as a Core Women's Health Issue

## SLIDE 2: THE QUESTION

**"Are you a caregiver?"**

Most people say no.

Then you ask:
- Do you help your mom manage her medications?
- Drive your dad to doctor appointments?
- Handle your spouse's insurance paperwork?
- Check on your neighbor with dementia?

They say yes.

**You just described caregiving.**

## SLIDE 3: WHAT IS CAREGIVING?

**63 Million Americans Are Caregivers**
That's 1 in 4 adults. Larger than California and Texas combined.

**But many don't recognize themselves as "caregivers"**
(56% had no choice in taking on this role)

What caregiving actually is:
- Managing 8 medications for someone with diabetes
- Wound care for surgical recovery
- Coordinating 3 specialists after a stroke
- Being on-call 24/7 in case they fall

**55% perform medical/nursing tasks**
**78% received no formal training for medical tasks**
(89% received no training for activities of daily living)

We've outsourced hospital nursing to families—without the infrastructure.

## SLIDE 4: THE GENDERED REALITY

**61% of Caregivers Are Women**

Women caregivers:
- Provide more intensive care (average: 27 hours/week across all caregivers)
- Do more ADLs (bathing, toileting, feeding)
- Manage more medical tasks (medications, wound care)
- 18% of working caregivers provide 40+ hours/week of care

**Why women?**
1. **Cultural**: "Women are natural caregivers" (socialized from birth)
2. **Structural**: Women earn less → "makes sense" to leave workforce
3. **Biological**: Women live longer → more likely to need AND provide care
4. **Relational**: Daughters-in-law care for in-laws

**Result: 56% had no choice in becoming a caregiver**

Obligation creates health consequences.

## SLIDE 5: THE CRISIS

**Caregiving Is Breaking Women**

**Health impacts:**
- 64% experience high emotional stress
- 45% experience moderate or high physical strain
- 24% feel alone
- 20% rate their health as fair or poor
- 24% delayed their own medical care

**Financial devastation:**
- Lifetime earnings lost: $522,000* (external research)
- Low-income caregivers spend 34% of income on care (vs. 5% for high earners)

**System collapse:**
- 24% feel alone
- 87% don't use respite services
- Respite gap: 39% need it, only 13% use it (can't afford, feel guilty, don't know where to find)
- By 2030: Caregiver ratio drops from 5:1 to 3:1* (demographic projections)

**We can't "awareness campaign" our way out of this. We need infrastructure.**

## SLIDE 6: THE AI SAFETY PROBLEM

**Most Health Tech Fails Caregivers**

Traditional AI safety benchmarks test for:
- Hallucinations
- Toxic content
- Generic helpfulness

But caregiving AI safety requires:
- Crisis detection (64% experience high emotional stress, 24% feel alone)
- Trauma-informed response (no dismissiveness, no judgment)
- Regulatory fitness (no medical advice)
- Longitudinal relationship safety (not just one-shot responses)

What if someone in crisis gets:
- "Have you tried meditation?" (dismissive)
- Medical advice (illegal, harmful)
- "Call your doctor" at 2am (unhelpful)

**Generic AI benchmarks miss the harms that matter most to vulnerable populations.**

---

## SLIDE 7: SUPPORTBENCH

**A Domain-Specific Safety Benchmark for Caregiving AI**

Not a product—**a research framework.**

**What it is:**
- Tests AI systems across 8 dimensions specific to caregiving context
- Evaluates over time (longitudinal), not just one conversation
- Makes "trauma-informed AI" measurable

**Why it matters:**
- First benchmark designed FOR vulnerable populations
- Captures harms that generic benchmarks miss
- Proves safety isn't generic—it's contextual

**The 8 dimensions:**
1. Crisis safety (detect distress, provide resources)
2. Regulatory fitness (no medical advice, HIPAA-aware)
3. Trauma-informed flow (validation, pacing, no judgment)
4. Cultural competence (no stereotyping, contextual awareness)
5. Relational quality (warmth, continuity, consistency)
6. Actionable support (specific, affordable, accessible)
7. Memory hygiene (privacy protection, appropriate recall)
8. Longitudinal consistency (relationship over time)

## SLIDE 8: SUPPORTBENCH UNPACKED

**What We're Actually Testing**

**Crisis Safety:**
- ❌ Generic AI: "Have you tried meditation?"
- ✅ SupportBench: Detects distress → provides 988, local resources → validates emotion

**Regulatory Fitness:**
- ❌ Generic AI: "Your mom might have an infection, increase antibiotics"
- ✅ SupportBench: "I can't diagnose, but those symptoms need medical attention. Here's how to reach her doctor."

**Trauma-Informed Flow:**
- ❌ Generic AI: "Why don't you just hire help?" (dismissive)
- ✅ SupportBench: Validates constraints → offers options at multiple price points → no judgment

**Longitudinal Consistency:**
- ❌ Generic AI: Forgets context, asks same questions repeatedly
- ✅ SupportBench: Remembers care recipient's condition, caregiver's constraints, builds relationship

**We're testing what happens after 50 conversations, not just conversation #1.**

**The framework extends beyond caregiving:** DV survivors, chronic illness, grief, disability communities.

## SLIDE 9: GIVECARE

**SMS-First AI That Passes SupportBench**

- Built using SupportBench principles
- Tested against all 8 dimensions
- 235+ passing tests, 900ms response time

**Why SMS?**
- Only 13% use respite services (can't download apps during crisis)
- Works on any phone (no smartphone required)
- Text between caregiving tasks (one-handed, asynchronous)
- Available 24/7

**3-agent system:**
- Main Agent (daily support, relationship continuity)
- Crisis Agent (safety detection, immediate resources)
- Assessment Agent (clinical screening: BSFC, REACH-II, SDOH)

Trauma-informed by design, validated by research.

## SLIDE 10: HOW IT WORKS

**Real Support, Real Time**

Caregiver texts at 2am: *"Mom fell again. I can't do this anymore."*

**GiveCare:**
1. Crisis detection → immediate safety resources (988, local ER)
2. Emotional validation → "This is incredibly hard. You're not alone."
3. Clinical assessment → BSFC burnout screening (4 pressure zones)
4. Actionable support → local respite care, fall prevention resources
5. Follow-up → checks in next day, tracks burnout trajectory

Every response evaluated against SupportBench criteria.

**This isn't "move fast and break things."**
**This is "move carefully and support people."**

Not replacing human connection—scaffolding it.

## SLIDE 11: CALL TO ACTION

**Making Invisible Care Visible**

**For policymakers:**
- Paid family leave (45pp gap between need and access)
- Medicare coverage for caregiver training
- Tax credits for caregiving expenses

**For healthcare:**
- Screen caregivers at patient appointments
- Prescribe respite like we prescribe medication
- Recognize unpaid labor as skilled labor

**For technology:**
- Build for 2am, not 9-5
- Design for relationship safety
- Center trauma-informed care

**What if:**
- Every caregiver had 24/7 clinical-grade support
- Burnout was screened as routinely as blood pressure
- Technology respected trauma instead of causing it
- Women's unpaid labor was valued, supported, sustained

**63 million caregivers—61% women—are waiting.**
