Subject: [PATCH] feat: improve SMS signup messaging with value props

- Replace "Welcome to GiveCare!" pre-subscription message with value-focused intro
- New message highlights solving isolation/overwhelm/resource finding
- Emphasizes 24/7 text-based support
- Creates two-step intro (value intro -> personalized welcome)
- Update grace_period, grace_expired, past_due, incomplete messages with benefits
- Eliminates repetitive "Welcome" messaging
