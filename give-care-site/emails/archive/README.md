# React Email Components (Archived)

**Date Archived**: 2025-11-04
**Reason**: LLM email system removed due to runtime incompatibility

## Contents
- **components/**: Beautiful React Email component library (761 LOC)
- **tokens.ts**: Design system tokens

## Status
Well-designed but never rendered in production. Preserved for future use if we set up a Node.js email rendering service.

## To Use in Future
1. Deploy separate Next.js app for email rendering
2. Wire Convex actions to Next.js API routes
3. Import these components in the rendering service
