# 🎙️ Voice Integration Plan for GiveCare

## Executive Summary

**Complexity**: **Medium** (6-8 weeks implementation)  
**Cost Impact**: **Low** (using existing Azure credits)  
**Architecture Fit**: **High** (excellent synergy with current Agno-native system)

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Advantages

### **✅ What Works in Your Favor:**

1. **Agno Framework**: Already handles multi-modal agent orchestration
2. **Azure OpenAI**: You have credits + existing models that support voice
3. **DCR Pattern**: Dynamic context retrieval works perfectly for voice
4. **Subscription System**: Already built for premium features
5. **Medical Guardrails**: Ultra-fast Verdict system works for voice too
6. **User Lifecycle**: Authentication and onboarding already robust

### **🔧 What Needs Extension:**

1. **Audio Processing**: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech
2. **Voice API Endpoints**: New FastAPI routes for voice calls
3. **Twilio Voice**: Extend existing Twilio integration
4. **Real-time Processing**: Handle live audio streams

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**

**Goal**: Basic voice call handling

```python
# New endpoints to add
@app.post("/voice/incoming")  # Handle incoming calls
@app.post("/voice/gather")    # Process speech input
@app.post("/voice/respond")   # Generate voice responses
```

**Azure Services Needed**:
- **Azure Speech Services** (Speech-to-Text + Text-to-Speech)
- **Existing Azure OpenAI** (no new models needed)

**Twilio Extensions**:
- **Twilio Voice API** (upgrade from SMS-only)
- **TwiML Voice** (XML responses for calls)

### **Phase 2: Agno Integration (Week 3-4)**

**Goal**: Seamless SMS↔Voice handoff using Agno

```python
# Enhanced agent with voice tools
voice_agent = Agent(
    name="Mira-Voice",
    model=base_model,  # Same Azure OpenAI model
    tools=[
        TwilioVoiceTools(),     # New voice tools
        get_user_caregiving_context,  # Same DCR tool
        medical_safety_check,   # Same guardrails
        voice_to_text_tool,
        text_to_voice_tool,
    ],
    instructions=voice_instructions,  # Voice-optimized prompts
    memory=memory,  # Same memory system
    storage=storage,  # Same conversation storage
)
```

**Key Advantage**: Agno automatically handles:
- ✅ Cross-modal conversation continuity (SMS→Voice→SMS)
- ✅ Same memory system across channels
- ✅ Same DCR context retrieval
- ✅ Same medical guardrails

### **Phase 3: Premium Features (Week 5-6)**

**Goal**: Advanced voice capabilities

- **Real-time Transcription**: Live speech processing
- **Voice Emotions**: Detect stress/urgency in voice
- **Emergency Detection**: Voice-based 911 routing
- **Voice Preferences**: User voice settings in profile

### **Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7-8)**

**Goal**: Production performance

- **Edge Processing**: Minimize latency
- **Voice Caching**: Cache common responses
- **Load Balancing**: Handle multiple calls
- **Analytics**: Voice usage metrics

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### **Azure Credits Usage**:
- **Speech Services**: ~$1-4 per hour of calls
- **Azure OpenAI**: Already budgeted (same models)
- **Storage**: Minimal additional cost

### **Twilio Voice**:
- **Incoming Calls**: ~$0.0085/minute
- **Outgoing Calls**: ~$0.013/minute
- **Phone Numbers**: ~$1/month per number

**Total Estimated**: **$50-200/month** for moderate usage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema Changes**:
```sql
-- Add voice-specific fields to users
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN voice_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preferred_voice TEXT DEFAULT 'alloy';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN call_preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Track voice calls
CREATE TABLE voice_calls (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  twilio_call_sid TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  direction TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'inbound' or 'outbound'
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  recording_url TEXT,
  transcription TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  ended_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### **New Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Azure Speech Services
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_speech_key
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=eastus

# Voice Models
AZURE_TTS_DEPLOYMENT=tts-1
AZURE_STT_DEPLOYMENT=whisper-1

# Twilio Voice
TWILIO_VOICE_URL=https://your-domain.com/voice/incoming
```

### **Agno Voice Tools**:
```python
@tool(name="speech_to_text")
async def speech_to_text(audio_url: str) -> str:
    """Convert speech to text using Azure Speech Services"""
    # Process Twilio recording URL
    # Return transcribed text

@tool(name="text_to_speech") 
async def text_to_speech(text: str, voice: str = "alloy") -> str:
    """Convert text to speech using Azure OpenAI TTS"""
    # Generate TwiML with audio URL
    # Return TwiML response

@tool(name="transfer_to_emergency")
async def transfer_to_emergency(reason: str) -> str:
    """Transfer call to 911 if emergency detected"""
    # Use Twilio to transfer call
    # Log emergency event
```

## 🎭 User Experience Flow

### **Incoming Call Experience**:
1. **User calls GiveCare number**
2. **Twilio** → `/voice/incoming` → **Agno Voice Agent**
3. **Agent** calls `get_user_caregiving_context()` (same DCR)
4. **Natural conversation** with same personality as SMS
5. **Seamless handoff**: "I'll text you a summary"

### **SMS↔Voice Continuity**:
```
SMS: "I'm stressed about mom's medication"
↓
User calls 5 minutes later
↓
Voice Agent: "I remember you mentioned stress about 
your mom's medication. Let's talk through this..."
```
