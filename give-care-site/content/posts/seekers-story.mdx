### Opening Breath  
Co-host **Dr. Monique Smith**—Founder & Executive Director of **Health DesignED** at Emory University School of Medicine—opened the Conference with an alternate-nostril breathing exercise. The shared inhale–exhale grounded the room, signaled psychological safety, and reminded us that every design decision must honor the body’s most basic rhythms. 

That calm focus set the stage for the next one-and-a-half days.

### From Curbside to Community  
**Heartbeat on the Street**, a two-hour design sprint led by **Katie Abbott** (Co-Founder & COO) and **Dr. Manisha Sharma** (Co-Founder & Chief Care Innovation Officer) at [MitoKhon](https://mitokhon.com/), split participants into three breakout groups—Suburban, Urban, and Rural. Guided by six anchors—social-medicine basics, heart-centered insight, innovation within regulation, ripple-effect inspiration, cross-sector collaboration, and an open “?” for community-defined needs—each team sketched a Street Medicine + Nourishment program.  

Our table traced family caregiver *Maria Lopez*’s journey from fearful newcomer to empowered neighborhood advocate, surfacing levers like transportation, childcare, and micro-credentials that turn caregivers from recipients of help into co-designers.

### Story as Infrastructure  
Picking up that local momentum, futures strategist **Hillary Carey** of [Just Visions](https://justvisions.com/) supplied the narrative voltage:

> “Creating visions of inspiring future outcomes can be a leverage point for change—and a resilience practice.”

Vision, Carey reminded us, is **tension**—“the stretch between *what is* and *what could be*,” echoing futurist **Ruud van der Helm**. When caregivers sketch futures aloud—*“What if hospice intake felt like a hotel check-in?”*—they hand designers and clinicians a map worth following.

*Lunch-break aside:* Carey shared that her own lodestar is **racial justice in design**—proof that choosing one cause and going deep keeps big futures work grounded in daily practice.

### Designing in an Ethic of Care — and Belonging  
Social-worker-turned-designer **Rachael Dietkus**, founder of [Social Workers Who Design](https://socialworkerswhodesign.com/), grounded the conversation:

> “Design at its core is **about shaping conditions**. Every interaction affirms—or diminishes—dignity.”

Drawing on UC Berkeley’s **[Othering & Belonging Institute](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/)**, Dietkus challenged teams to **recognize, protect, cultivate, tend, honor,** and **celebrate** care at every touchpoint.  

Earlier, Conference co-host **Chris McCarthy** of [ILN](https://www.iln.org/) reinforced the point with a story of his mother’s long hallway wait—proof that dignity is decided in the margins of care.

> “Hopefulness is the warrior emotion that can lay waste to cynicism.” — **Nick Cave**  

Hope, then, is not naïve; it is design fuel.

### Public Health at the Margins  
Later, **Dr. Fred Rachman** of [AllianceChicago](https://alliancechicago.org/) convened an open-space session, ”Strategies to Broaden Appreciation of the Importance of Supports and to Engage in Evidence-Based Public-Health-Level Activity,” a few key points:

* **Modernize messaging** and meet audiences where they scroll (see **Dr. Syra Madad’s** [Critical Health Voices](https://criticalhealthvoices.substack.com/)).  
* **Co-design solutions** with **Community Health Workers (CHWs)** and other trusted locals.  
* **Elevate Patient Advocacy** and other community-rooted certification paths.  
* **Quantify and communicate ROI** to employers, payers, and policymakers—*and* pair those numbers with values-based framing, because, as **Meghan Bausone** of [Medusa Design Lab](https://www.medusadesignlab.com) noted with abortion access, financial arguments alone can still be overridden by ideology.

**Matthew McCurdy** of **[BLKHLTH](https://www.blkhlth.com/)** stressed that disparities widen at the margins; renewal must start where vulnerability begins.  _For more on community-driven health infrastructure, see **“AI, Care, and Community: Insights from Blooming Day 2025.”**_

### The Four Archetypes  
The auditorium fell silent as **Susannah Fox**, former CTO of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, delivered the closing keynote. Her pared-down deck introduced four archetypes:

> “**Seekers** go on the hunt.”  
> “**Networkers** pool resources.”  
> “**Solvers** attack problems.”  
> “**Champions** fast-track innovations.”

Fox—author of *[Rebel Health](https://susannahfox.com/rebel-health/)*—mapped the social circuitry of change:

* **Seekers** dig into Reddit rabbit holes at 2 a.m. to decode a parent’s cryptic lab results.  
* **Networkers** spin up WhatsApp threads so cousins on three continents can swap wound-care hacks in real time.  
* **Solvers** turning engineering skills into DIY diabetes tools for a child.
* **Champions** persuade HR to extend back-up FMLA or convince an insurer to cover a critical device.

Most caregivers cycle through all four roles in a single week—sometimes in a single day. Yet none of it works, Fox warned, when need and know-how never meet:

> “There are people who would love to help you **if only they knew how to find you**.”

For caregivers, visibility isn’t branding—it’s survival.

### Threads to Take Home  
Progress in health and caregiving is less a pipeline of breakthroughs than a braid of *people, story, and ethics*:

* **Embodiment:** Begin with the body—breath, posture, sensory cues—because physiological safety is the floor on which every higher-order interaction stands.  
* **People:** Map the Seeker–Networker–Solver–Champion ecosystem around any condition you care about.  
* **Story:** Paint the future so vividly that colleagues can step into it and start rearranging the present.  
* **Systems:** Pair micro-interactions with macro-advocacy; local hacks only scale sustainably when policy and infrastructure move in parallel.  
* **Shared ROI:** Frame dignity as an economic engine—lower readmits, stronger retention, resilient communities—so payers and employers see themselves in the solution.  
* **Ethics:** Audit every micro-interaction for dignity—and for belonging; design is happening there whether you notice or not.

None of this requires permission—only practice.

**PS.** Still need a feel for *Design for Dignity*? Pulling into the parking lot approaching midnight, co-host **Amy Heymans** of [Beneficent](https://www.beneficent.design/) graciously greeted me and handed me a welcome kit for my dorm room. My roommate? **[Jason Cunningham](https://www.wchealth.org/)**—a physician who understood “systems thinking” and “human-centered design” more than most designers I know.
