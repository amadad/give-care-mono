# Caregiving Under Threat: Navigating Policy Risks in the 119th Congress

Care connects us all. Each of us will need to give or receive care at some point in our lives. With the upcoming 119th Congress and a second Trump administration, there is considerable risk for caregivers, care workers, and all our communities. Whether it's disabled individuals and older adults striving for independent living, family caregivers providing essential support, or care workers—often Black, Brown, and immigrant women—delivering vital services, the stakes couldn't be higher.

We loved the recent webinar from [Caring Across Generations](https://caringacross.org/), "Wicked Plans in the 119th Congress," and wanted to highlight the significant caregiving-related risks and the urgent need for community action.

## The Crucial Role of Medicaid for Caregivers

### A Lifeline for Families
*"Medicaid is a lifeline for family caregivers, as it provides services allowing caregivers to maintain employment or return to work after caregiving."*

**Impact:** Without Medicaid, caregivers risk job loss and increased financial burdens.

### Stabilizing the Care Workforce
*"Nearly a third of direct care workers receive health insurance through Medicaid, with nearly half relying on public assistance due to low wages."*

**Impact:** Cuts to Medicaid threaten professional caregiving stability, limiting essential care options for families.

### Supporting Long-Term Care
*"Medicaid funds the majority of long-term care in the U.S., including home and community-based services (HCBS)."*

**Impact:** Funding reductions jeopardize these services, shifting additional burdens onto family caregivers.

## Economic Choices Impacting Caregiving

### Risks to Essential Care Services
*"Optional Medicaid services, including home and community-based services, are often first targeted for cuts, directly impacting caregivers and care workers."*

**Impact:** Losing these services means reduced caregiving support, increased stress, and compromised care quality.

### Tax Priorities vs. Care Investments
*"Proposed tax cuts totaling $4 trillion to $8 trillion could instead fund crucial caregiving policies."*

**Impact:** Prioritizing tax cuts could leave caregiving significantly underfunded and caregivers unsupported.

### Importance of Medicaid Expansion
*"In the 10 states without Medicaid expansion, 150,000 direct care workers remain uninsured."*

**Impact:** Medicaid expansion directly supports caregivers by providing crucial healthcare coverage and financial relief.

## Addressing Disparities in Caregiving

### Intersectional Risks
*"Family caregivers in Black, Brown, immigrant, and LGBTQIA communities face disproportionate impacts from potential Medicaid cuts."*

**Impact:** These communities risk exacerbated healthcare inequities and financial stress due to decreased caregiving support.

### Empowering Caregiver Advocacy
*"Grassroots mobilization of caregivers and care workers is essential to protecting Medicaid and caregiving policies."*

**Impact:** Active caregiver participation in advocacy efforts is key to shaping supportive caregiving policies.

## Broader Policy Implications

### Medicaid Work Requirements
*"Medicaid work requirements create administrative hurdles, causing caregivers to lose critical healthcare coverage."*

**Impact:** Overburdened caregivers may face healthcare insecurity and increased vulnerability.

### Supporting Caregiver Well-Being
*"Medicaid services significantly alleviate emotional and financial burdens by providing essential in-home support."*

**Impact:** Medicaid cuts risk accelerating caregiver burnout, reducing overall caregiving sustainability.

## Summary of Key Caregiving Risks

- **Financial Hardship:** Increased out-of-pocket costs for family caregivers.
- **Workforce Instability:** Disruption in professional care services due to Medicaid cuts.
- **Health Risks:** Heightened caregiver stress, burnout, and loss of healthcare resources.
- **Advocacy Urgency:** Critical need for caregivers’ active involvement in policy advocacy.

Caregiving is foundational to our collective well-being. Protecting caregiving resources requires sustained advocacy, ensuring policymakers prioritize care as a fundamental public good.
