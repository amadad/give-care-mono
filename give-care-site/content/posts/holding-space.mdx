For May’s [People for Patient Safety (PPS)](https://www.pulsecenterforpatientsafety.org/pps)  forum, chaplain **Cody Hufstedler** distilled more than a decade of palliative-care chaplaincy and his [*Dying to Tell You* podcast](https://dttypodcast.com/) into three deceptively simple practices: *stay present, honor contradictions, invite joy*. The conversation quickly transcended bedside etiquette, touching on the social fabrics that hold—or fray—when families confront mortality.

> “Being sick is lonely … even when the room is full.”  
> *—Cody Hufstedler*

That line set the tone for an hour that explored far more than Kleenex moments. Below are the big-picture insights—and how they connect to GiveCare’s mission and our advisory work with **[A Better Goodbye](https://majorchanges.org/bettergoodbye)**, a national initiative to normalize end-of-life conversations.

## 1. Presence Is Powerful—Especially When Cultures Collide

Cody opened with a story of **missing** the moment by rushing to fetch tissues, breaking a sacred silence with a well-meaning but unnecessary gesture. Many caregivers feel similar pressure to *do* rather than *be*, particularly in multigenerational households where elders equate care with constant action.

## 2. Two Feelings Can Be True—and So Can Two Worldviews  

> “I can be devastated that my father is dying **and** relieved his suffering will end.”  

During Q&A, **Ali Madad**—GiveCare founder *and an advisor to* **[A Better Goodbye](https://majorchanges.org/bettergoodbye)**—asked how caregivers might better hold *two cultural truths* at once: the medical system’s protocols **and** an immigrant family’s rituals that rarely fit textbook timelines. Cody’s reply: *“Ask earlier, ask often, and leave room for answers you don’t expect.”*

## 3. Humor Isn’t Sacrilege; It’s Relief  

Cody recalled a wedding-obsessed patient whose family erupted in laughter when she admitted the nuptials were still “TBD.” That burst of joy cut through dread and created the day’s most honest moment. Laughter, he noted, can coexist with grief and even deepen connection.

## 4. The Immigrant Experience: Invisible Load, Invisible Wisdom  

Immigrant caregivers often juggle language barriers, remittance pressures, and visa constraints on top of grief. Ali’s closing question—*“How can healthcare teams invite immigrant families’ wisdom instead of sidelining it?”*—sparked a lively exchange of lived experience:

* **Shlomit, a hospice social worker**, described a Vietnamese family who brought homemade spring rolls to the hospital every day as an act of love. Staff initially viewed the food as an infection risk; only after conversation did they understand it was a sacred gesture of nourishment and presence.  
* **Maria, a second-generation Dominican American caregiver**, shared how extended prayer circles at the bedside calmed his mother, but clashed with rigid visiting-hour policies. Negotiating extra time required persistent advocacy and cultural translation.  

Suggestions that emerged:

- **Language justice:** engage certified interpreters early, not just for consent forms.  
- **Ritual flexibility:** carve out space for bedside prayers, incense, or family-prepared foods when safely possible.  
- **Story exchange:** invite families to share homeland end-of-life customs so clinicians can weave those values into care plans.

## 5. From Conversation to Movement  

Cody’s talk dovetailed with the goals of *A Better Goodbye*, a national initiative that frames death literacy as a public-health imperative. The program calls for:

1. **Reframing** death as part of life through annual *Conversation Week* campaigns.  
2. **Engaging** communities via salon-style gatherings reminiscent of historical “Death Cafés.”  
3. **Supporting** families with practical, culturally relevant planning tools.

Cody’s mantra—*presence, permission, positivity*—offers a universal starting point for dialogues that often stall in fear.
