# Why Evidence-Based Assessments Matter

Family caregivers experience profound stress, burnout, and emotional strain, yet many remain unseen by traditional healthcare. Validated, evidence-based assessments are critical to measuring the true state of caregiver health and emotional wellbeing, enabling targeted interventions and support.

GiveCare meets caregivers where they are: texting. Behind our simple, conversational UX is a rigorous selection of clinically validated assessments.

## Choosing the Right Instruments

Not all assessments fit our SMS-native delivery. They must be:
- **Concise** ‚Äî Caregivers have limited time and energy.
- **Clinically validated** ‚Äî Ensuring results accurately reflect caregiver realities.
- **Adaptable** ‚Äî Able to be seamlessly integrated into daily text interactions.

Here's a brief look at our licensing journey for integrating these measures into GiveCare.

### ‚úÖ Freely Available, Generously Shared
- **Caregiver Well-Being Scale (CWBS)** (Dr. Susan Tebb)
  - Free licensing, open translations, long history of clinical use.
- **PROMIS¬Æ Measures (Fatigue, Distress)** (HealthMeasures)
  - Widely validated, clear terms, flexible integration (pending final selection).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional Licensing & Negotiation
- **PRAPARE¬Æ Social Risk Screening** (National PRAPARE Team)
  - Licensing terms vary based on organizational structure; pending clarity.
- **Caregiver Indirect & Informal Cost Questionnaire (CIIQ)** (Dr. Erik Landfeldt)
  - Baseline fee (‚Ç¨10K), discounts available; SMS adaptation supported.

### ‚ùå Licensing Challenges & Denials
- **Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC)** (Prof. Elmar Gr√§√üel)
  - Strictly non-commercial; must remain universally free for caregivers.

### üîÑ Institutional Redirects & Complexities
- **Modified Caregiver Strain Index (CSI)** (Hartford Institute/NYU)
  - Licensing managed externally; redirected to original authors and copyright clearinghouse.
- **Marwit‚ÄìMeuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI)** (Dr. Tom Meuser)
  - Original author retired; requires new institutional coordination.

### üì≠ Still Awaiting Responses
- **Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES-8)** (Dr. K. Sheth)
- **Brief Assessment Scale for Caregivers (BASC)** (Dr. M. Glajchen)
- **Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA)** (Dr. C. Given)

## Why Baseline Measurement Is Critical

Getting an accurate initial picture (baseline) of caregiver status is essential. Baselines:
- Enable personalized interventions based on real data.
- Create clear progress tracking, showing caregivers tangible improvement.
- Build caregiver self-awareness and empowerment over time.

## Progressive Profiling: An Elegant UX Solution

Instead of overwhelming caregivers with lengthy assessments, GiveCare leverages progressive profiling:
- **Micro-bursts:** Short, conversational questions woven naturally into daily texts.
- **Incremental learning:** Gradually building richer caregiver profiles without friction.
- **Adaptive timing:** Assessments delivered contextually, responding to caregiver availability and mood.

The result: rigorous data collection without caregiver burnout.

## What's Next for GiveCare

We're finalizing licensing, adapting assessments into SMS-friendly language, and preparing cultural adaptations for diverse caregiver communities.

Our goal: to embed clinical rigor into an everyday texting experience, making caregiver wellbeing measurable, visible, and improvable.

**Bottom line:** Validated assessments matter. GiveCare integrates them seamlessly, giving caregivers the evidence-based support they deserve‚Äîright at their fingertips.
