# Why 24/7 access matters

CMS’s **Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model** launches this July and runs for eight years, testing a standardized dementia-care package under Medicare. One line is non-negotiable: **beneficiaries and caregivers must have 24/7 access to a trained care-team member or helpline**. That sounds simple—until you price night-shift staffing or try to integrate a third-party call center into your EHR.  

GiveCare **augments** that requirement with an always‑on, SMS‑first assistant that *triages* incoming concerns, surfaces dementia‑specific guidance, and immediately escalates or warm‑transfers to your on‑call team. In other words, we help you meet the mandate efficiently—**without attempting to satisfy it through automation alone.**

## The GUIDE 24/7 Access Requirement in Plain English

* **Mandatory** – Mandatoryn public hotline detours.

* **Audit-ready** – Encounters must be documented and looped back into the dementia care-management plan.  

**Important:** CMS expects a *live* care‑team member (or contracted nurse‑triage line) to be reachable by phone at all times. AI tools can *support* but not *replace* this requirement. GiveCare’s role is to handle first‑line questions and prep call notes so human responders can focus on clinical judgment.

Failure to comply risks lost incentive payments and potential removal from the model.

## The Hidden Cost of “Doing It Yourself”

1. **Staffing** – Overnight RNs or dementia‑trained staff (≈ $300 k/yr for two full‑time positions).
2. **Training** – Dementia-specific de-escalation skills aren’t standard in nurse-triage playbooks; 50 % of cases go undiagnosed, making nuanced protocols critical.  
3. **Infrastructure** – Secure telephony, EHR integration, and call-record storage add CAPEX and ongoing maintenance.

Add it up and small practices quickly see margins evaporate.

## GiveCare: A Plug-and-Play Path to Compliance  

Below is a quick look at how GiveCare maps to each key GUIDE expectation:

- **Always‑on triage** — Caregivers can text GiveCare at any hour for instant, evidence‑based tips *and* a quick escalation path to your live helpline when needed.

- **Dementia‑specific micro‑interventions** — Actionable, plain‑language scripts (wandering, sundowning, toileting, etc.) that stabilize situations until a nurse or MD joins the call.

- **Documentation loop** — *FHIR-ready logs.* Every chat lands in Supabase and syncs nightly to your EHR.

- **Burnout radar** — *Personalized self-care nudges.* Language-based stress score auto-triggers respite referral (up to $2.5 k/yr in GUIDE funds).

### Why AI‑Assisted Humans Beat Humans‑Only

* **Scalability** – GiveCare absorbs common after‑hours questions, so live clinicians can focus on complex or urgent issues while still remaining compliant with GUIDE’s phone‑access rule.
* **Empathy at scale** – NLP models respond with validated emotional-support language, reducing caregiver distress—key when 40 % report depression.  
* **Learning system** – Each interaction fine-tunes future responses, making the service smarter—and your caregivers happier—over time.

## Unlocking GUIDE Revenue Faster

GUIDE isn’t just a compliance sprint; it opens new revenue streams:

* **Monthly DCP payments** for enrolled beneficiaries.  
* **Respite reimbursements** up to \$2,500 per patient per year.  
* **Quality bonuses** tied to reduced hospitalization and improved caregiver outcomes.  

GiveCare’s analytics dashboards link helpline usage to these KPIs, helping you prove value to CMS and private payers alike.

## Getting Started

1. **Schedule a sandbox demo**—see AI triage in action.  
2. **Connect your on-call roster**—no new hardware required.  
3. **Go live in 30 days**—hit the July launch with full 24/7 compliance.

**Regulatory note:** CMS may refine GUIDE guidance over time. Always review the latest FAQ and verify that any digital triage workflow includes a documented, immediate pathway to live clinical support.

> **Bottom line:** GUIDE mandates 24/7 live phone access; GiveCare trims the workload, improves documentation, and makes that mandate sustainable—without cutting humans out of the loop.
