Talking about death shouldn't be taboo. Honest conversation makes life better.

On August 22, 2025, I partnered with [The Alliance of Professional Health Advocates (APHA)](https://aphadvocates.org/) to host our first online Death Caf√© ‚Äî a welcoming space for advocates and caregivers to talk openly about death, dying, and grief in a supportive, non-judgmental circle.

It wasn't therapy. It wasn't a panel. It was a space.

We gathered ‚Äî some in cars, others in childhood bedrooms, one person from a UPS store. And we talked. Some shared about siblings lost too young. Some reflected on long hospice goodbyes. Others simply listened.

> ‚ÄúYou grieve every day before they die.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Participant, caregiving for parent with ALS*

## 1. Caregiving Is Grief in Real-Time

The stories that surfaced weren‚Äôt just about death. They were about *endings that start early*: the slow loss of memory, independence, voice. One attendee recalled her father asking to hold his wife‚Äôs hand from his hospice bed ‚Äî a rare act of affection that signaled, in hindsight, that he knew.

> ‚ÄúThe caregiving ends, and then your identity is just... gone. The silence afterward is so loud.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Independent patient advocate*

## 2. Grief Comes in Many Forms‚ÄîAnd All Are Valid

Some talked about tragic accidents. Others about complicated parents and unresolved feelings. A few said they‚Äôd never even cried about their losses ‚Äî *not because they didn‚Äôt care*, but because there was too much else to manage.

> ‚ÄúI loved him. And I‚Äôm still angry. That‚Äôs the grief I live with.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Caregiver, after sudden loss of father-in-law*

## 3. Children Are Always Watching (and Learning)

Several participants spoke about helping young kids understand death. One shared how her daughter, then four, believed grandpa was in a ‚Äúsolitary‚Äù because she couldn‚Äôt grasp cremation. Another had Googled, *‚Äúhow to explain ashes to a child.‚Äù*

> ‚ÄúEvery cemetery we passed, she‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄòIs that Poppy‚Äôs solitary?‚Äô‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Parent, post-loss of a grandparent*

Others talked about *teaching grief literacy early*, before kids inherit silence as their only model.

## 4. When Systems Fail to Make Space, We Must

Caregivers described the difficult emotional terrain of navigating death within busy, structured lives. The conversation returned often to how grief is squeezed between logistics ‚Äî paperwork, travel, meal planning, child care ‚Äî especially when formal support ends abruptly after death.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to grieve, but you‚Äôre still the one coordinating everything.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Participant reflection*

## 5. Sharing Resources, Holding Space

We closed with a collective resource share ‚Äî not prescriptions, but *invitations* for deeper engagement:

## It's Not Over

What I learned that night is that grief isn't linear, and it doesn't wait for permission. It shows up in grocery stores, during work calls, at bedtime. The caregivers in that circle weren't looking for answers‚Äîthey were looking for witnesses.

And that's what we'll keep doing. Creating space. Holding silence. Letting people know they're not alone in the hardest parts.

We'll host another Death Caf√© soon. No pressure to speak. Just bring your story, or your silence. Maybe some tea and something sweet.
