# AI and Compassionate Care

*We attended a recent insightful webinar hosted by [C-TAC](https://thectac.org) and the [Coalition for Compassionate Care of California (CCCC)](https://coalitionccc.org), titled *\"Exploring AI Utilization in Serious Illness Care,\"* to inform our ongoing development at GiveCare—our AI-powered caregiving assistant. Here are some takeaways and reflections from healthcare leaders about leveraging AI ethically and compassionately to enhance caregiving.*

Healthcare leaders, providers, and patient advocates recently convened to discuss the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in serious illness and end-of-life care. Representatives from diverse healthcare organizations shared enthusiasm, caution, and valuable insights that GiveCare can leverage to continually improve our AI-powered caregiving solutions.

## Diverse Interests, Unified Curiosity

Participants represented various healthcare sectors, from advanced care planning to supportive cancer care and hospice providers. Dan Haire, President and CEO of Navian Hawaii, showed interest in how AI could optimize efficiency—a key area for GiveCare’s ongoing development. Julie Goldstein from Advocate Health brought attention to AI’s potential in generating patient-centered advance care plans, an aspect central to GiveCare’s mission.

## Enhanced Care Delivery Through AI

Susan Nelson from Oscar Health highlighted successful integration of ambient listening technologies in documenting serious illness conversations. Her positive feedback underscores the potential for AI to enhance communication and accuracy, vital features that GiveCare seeks to embed further into our assistant.

## Ethical Considerations and Human Empathy

Ethical concerns were frequently addressed, notably by Stephanie Anderson from Iowa. Marisette Hasan from CTAC advocated for embedding an "equitable lens" into AI systems, aligning closely with GiveCare’s commitment to bias-free, inclusive caregiving solutions. Tara Friedman, MD, emphasized AI's supportive role without substituting genuine human empathy—a critical guideline for developing GiveCare's empathetic interactions.

## Cultural and Emotional Sensitivity

Paula Sanders from GHPCO stressed the importance of cultural sensitivity in AI applications, stressing the diversity and complexity of patient and caregiver needs. Julie Boudreau highlighted the necessity for evidence-based decisions, resonating deeply with GiveCare’s mission to provide validated, effective caregiving tools.

## Overcoming Adoption and Trust Barriers

Nichole Davis, a Board-Certified Patient Advocate, brought attention to trust-building challenges associated with healthcare innovations, emphasizing the importance of transparency and continued dialogue. This insight underscores the need for GiveCare to maintain clear communication, reliability, and user-centered development to build and sustain trust.

## Concluding Reflections

Attendees praised the session as insightful and thought-provoking. Marisette Hasan noted succinctly that the discussion illustrated the significant work ahead, affirming the balance between enthusiasm for AI innovation and caution toward its ethical implications.

GiveCare remains committed to developing an AI caregiving assistant that genuinely enhances caregiving experiences, is responsive to ethical considerations, and remains culturally sensitive and inclusive. Continuous engagement with healthcare professionals will help us refine and enhance our platform, ensuring GiveCare becomes an essential caregiving partner.
