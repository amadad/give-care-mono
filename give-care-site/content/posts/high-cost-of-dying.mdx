It costs a lot to die in America—emotionally, practically, and financially.

On October 7, 2025, I hosted our [second virtual Death Café](/words/early-goodbye) in partnership with [The Alliance of Professional Health Advocates (APHA)](https://aphadvocates.org/), bringing caregivers and patient advocates together for a candid, supportive conversation about death, dying, and the costs we rarely discuss openly.

Participants logged on late, after putting kids to bed, finishing work, or managing care responsibilities. As always, no therapy, no lectures—just honest conversation, milk and cookies, and a sense of solidarity.

## 1. The Taboo of Costly Goodbyes

One of the most striking themes was the financial stress of death. Attendees shared stories of nursing homes charging exorbitant fees—up to $17,000 a month—for end-of-life care, placing immense financial pressure on families already exhausted by caregiving.

> “People pay money to die. And they pay a lot.”  
> — *Participant reflection*

## 2. Hospice Isn't What People Think

Participants openly discussed misconceptions about hospice, noting many fear it means imminent death. They emphasized hospice can provide essential support over months or even years, yet financial structures sometimes discourage facilities from recommending hospice care—leaving families under-supported and overwhelmed.

> “Hospice is supposed to help you die comfortably, but the system is set up to discourage it.”  
> — *Participant insight*

## 3. Cultural Friction in End-of-Life Conversations

Several participants spoke about cultural barriers that complicate conversations about death, money, and caregiving arrangements. I shared my experience as a first-generation caregiver, noting how deeply religion and cultural expectations influenced my parents' attitudes toward death and preparation.

You can't talk openly about dying or planning—especially about finances—without it feeling like you're taking away someone's autonomy. Or worse, like you're rushing them toward death.

## 4. Caregivers Are Left Holding Too Much

Participants shared deeply personal stories of caring for parents and loved ones at home, highlighting the emotional toll when practical tasks—like changing diapers or managing complex medical needs—overshadowed meaningful final moments. Many wished they had professional help, allowing them simply to be present and supportive.

> “Family should be able to just hold hands, not manage logistics and personal care at the very end.”  
> — *Participant reflection*

## 5. Loneliness Makes Death Harder—and More Expensive

Isolation emerged as a silent, costly burden. Caregivers described watching loved ones face severe illness alone, often with insufficient support, increasing both emotional distress and financial costs. Friends frequently stepped in—but many admitted they wished families would reach out for more help.

> “We’ve built a system that’s set up for loneliness at the end of life.”  
> — *Participant observation*

## Death Is Free—Dying Isn't

We ended the evening reflecting on the stark disparity between dying as a natural process and dying as a costly transaction in America. The system extracts money, time, and dignity from families when they're most vulnerable.

But what struck me most wasn't the anger—it was the determination. Caregivers left committed to having harder conversations earlier, advocating for better policies, and most importantly, reaching out for support instead of carrying it all alone.

Because here's what we know: you can't afford to die in America. But you also can't afford to do this alone.
