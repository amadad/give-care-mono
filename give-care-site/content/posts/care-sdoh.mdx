If you're caring for a loved one, you know the weight of that responsibility. You're not alone—family caregivers provide the vast majority of long-term care in America. Yet when we looked at the tools available to understand and support caregivers' needs, we found a troubling gap: most were designed for patients, not the people caring for them.

That's why we built the <u>GC-SDOH-28</u>—a comprehensive screening tool that finally puts caregivers at the center. Here's our journey and what it means for you.

## Why Caregivers Need Their Own Tools

Picture this: You're juggling your parent's medical appointments, your kids' school schedules, and trying to hold down a job. You're asked to fill out yet another form about your "social needs," but the questions don't match your reality. They ask about your food security but not whether you've had time to eat. They screen for housing instability but miss that you're sleeping on your parent's couch to provide overnight care.

We evaluated over a dozen existing tools, each valuable in its own right. What we discovered wasn't that any single tool was inadequate—rather, caregivers needed something that brought together their many strengths into one comprehensive approach:

**Specialized tools excel in their domains but work in isolation**. The <u>Modified Caregiver Strain Index (M-CSI)</u> and <u>Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC)</u> beautifully capture emotional strain. The <u>NYU Caregiver Intervention Baseline</u> provides deep insights for dementia care. The <u>Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI)</u> thoughtfully addresses bereavement. Tools like the <u>Brief Assessment Scale for Caregivers (BASC)</u> and <u>Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CGSQ-SF7)</u> offer quick snapshots of caregiver wellbeing. Each serves an important purpose—but caregivers often need all these perspectives at once, not in separate silos.

**Excellent tools remain out of reach for many organizations**. <u>PRAPARE</u>'s comprehensive social needs assessment represents years of development but requires substantial annual licensing fees. <u>PROMIS CAT</u>'s sophisticated anxiety and depression measures come with significant costs for both paper and digital implementations. The <u>Modified CSI</u>, while valuable, restricts commercial use. These aren't unreasonable—developing and maintaining quality tools requires resources. But these costs create barriers for community organizations trying to help. Fortunately, some tools like the <u>REACH II Risk Appraisal Measure</u> remain freely available, showing another path is possible.

**The burden of redundancy falls on already-exhausted caregivers**. When we mapped questions across tools—including various <u>PROMIS</u> measures, social needs assessments, and caregiver strain indices—we found significant overlap. This isn't the tools' fault; they were developed independently for different purposes. But imagine being asked about food insecurity on three different forms when you barely have time to eat. The redundancy that makes sense academically becomes a real barrier to getting help.

## How We Built Something Better

We knew we could do better, so we embarked on a year-long journey to create a tool that works for real caregivers and the organizations supporting them.

First, we scoured the landscape, evaluating every major screening tool for what it covered, what it cost, and how well it worked. We kept the best of what worked: we're incorporating the freely-available <u>REACH II Risk Appraisal Measure</u> for dementia caregiver risk, the <u>CMS Accountable Health Communities</u> tool for core social needs, and—after securing special permission—the <u>Caregiver Well-Being Scale (CWBS)</u>, the only validated quality-of-life measure with 20+ years of evidence. We also drew from <u>Health Leads</u>' open-source toolkit to fill gaps in childcare and literacy screening.

We carefully curated questions from these validated tools, focusing on creating a comprehensive yet manageable assessment that captures the full spectrum of caregiver needs without overwhelming them.

The result? A focused set of 28 questions covering seven essential areas:

1. **Basic Needs** (6 questions): Food, utilities, housing, and transportation—the foundations that everything else builds on
2. **Safety** (4 questions): Both physical and emotional wellbeing
3. **Financial Strain** (3 questions): The economic reality of caregiving
4. **Health Literacy** (1 question): Can you navigate the healthcare maze?
5. **Self-Care & Quality of Life** (8 questions): Yes, your needs matter too
6. **Caregiver Burden** (4 questions): Measuring when it's becoming too much
7. **Social Connection** (2 questions): Because isolation makes everything harder

## From Assessment to Action: Focusing on Non-Clinical Support

The <u>GC-SDOH-28</u> is designed to identify needs and connect caregivers with non-clinical interventions. While we're still building out the full suite of automated responses, here's our vision for how each domain maps to practical support:

**Basic Needs**: The assessment identifies gaps in food security, housing stability, utilities, and transportation. Our goal is to integrate with local resource databases and benefits eligibility tools.

**Safety Screening**: High-risk scores would trigger urgent escalation protocols within care management systems, ensuring rapid response through existing support channels.

**Financial & Work Strain**: By understanding economic pressures, we can direct caregivers to relevant benefits programs, employer resources, and financial planning tools designed for their unique situation.

**Caregiver Wellbeing**: The CWBS components help identify when caregivers need respite, self-care resources, or connection to peer support networks—all non-clinical interventions that make a real difference.

**Social Support**: Isolation scores can prompt invitations to caregiver support groups, online communities, and local programs that reduce the feeling of being alone in this journey.

The key is distinguishing between clinical needs (which require healthcare providers) and the many non-clinical supports that can be delivered through community resources, digital tools, and peer networks.

## Making It Work in the Real World

The <u>GC-SDOH-28</u> is built around three core capabilities that enable effective non-clinical support:

**1. Smart Assessment & Triage**
- Validated questions identify needs across all seven domains
- Risk scoring helps prioritize who needs help first
- Clear distinction between clinical needs (requiring healthcare) and non-clinical needs (community resources, peer support, practical assistance)
- Mobile-first design makes it accessible to busy caregivers

**2. Resource Matching & Navigation**
- Assessment results map directly to specific types of non-clinical support
- Integration with community resource databases and benefits eligibility tools
- Connection to peer support networks and caregiver communities
- Personalized recommendations based on individual circumstances

**3. Continuous Support & Tracking**
- Journey dashboards (in development) to visualize caregiver needs over time
- Integration with care management systems for coordinated support
- Regular reassessment to catch changing needs
- Data insights to improve resource allocation and program development

For GUIDE-model providers, this approach helps meet caregiver assessment requirements while focusing on the practical, non-clinical supports that make the biggest difference in daily life.

## What Comes Next

We're launching Version 1.0 in July 2025, starting with GiveCare's text-message platform to make it as easy as possible for busy caregivers. But this is just the beginning.

We're committed to keeping this tool free and accessible. That means:

- **Open access**: All our materials—question texts, scoring guides, implementation tools—will be publicly available by July 2025
- **Continuous improvement**: We'll validate with diverse communities and update based on what we learn
- **Transparent process**: Every decision, every update, every license will be documented and shared
- **Real partnership**: We're actively seeking health systems and community organizations to help validate and improve the tool

## Why This Matters to All of Us

The <u>GC-SDOH-28</u> isn't just another assessment—it's recognition that caregivers are whole people with complex needs who deserve support designed specifically for them. By removing cost barriers and focusing on what actually helps, we're building infrastructure for a care system that truly sees and supports the people doing the caring.

Whether you're a caregiver yourself, work with caregivers, or are planning for your own future, this matters. Because at some point, we all need care—and we all need the people who provide it to be supported, not depleted.
