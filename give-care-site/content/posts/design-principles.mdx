We are deeply grateful to Rachel Dietkus for introducing us to the concept and practice of Trauma-Informed Design. Her groundbreaking work, ["The Call for Trauma-Informed Design Research and Practice"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360313850) (Design Management Review, 2022), has fundamentally shaped our understanding of how trauma intersects with design practice. As both a licensed clinical social worker and design strategist, Dietkus bridges two worlds that desperately need each other.

Caregiving often involves exposure to trauma—whether witnessing a loved one's suffering, navigating healthcare systems during crisis, or processing grief and loss. As Dietkus reminds us, trauma is "a rupture in meaning-making"—the way we see ourselves, the world, and others can be shocked and overturned by overwhelming events. The digital platforms caregivers rely on must recognize this reality and be designed to minimize harm while fostering healing and belonging.

## Understanding Trauma-Informed Design

The foundation of trauma-informed design comes from healthcare, specifically SAMHSA's six core principles: safety, trustworthiness & transparency, peer support, collaboration & mutuality, empowerment (voice & choice), and cultural/historical/gender sensitivity. While originally developed for in-person services, these principles powerfully translate to digital contexts.

### Defining Trauma in the Context of Design

Drawing from the work of Karine Bell, Resmaa Menakem, and Bessel van der Kolk, Dietkus offers a definition that resonates deeply with caregiving: "Trauma is a response to anything overwhelming, and that happens too much, too fast, too soon, or for too long." Crucially, she adds that trauma is "coupled with a psychological or physiological lack of protection or support" and "lives in the body stored as sensation: pain or tension—or a lack of sensation, like numbness."

For caregivers, this definition is painfully familiar. The overwhelm of medical decisions, the too-fast progression of illness, the too-soon losses, the too-long battles with insurance companies—all while feeling unsupported by systems meant to help. Our digital tools must acknowledge this embodied reality.

### Safety First: Creating Protective Digital Spaces

Eva Decker, in "To Build Gentler Technology, Practice Trauma-Informed Design" (2021), defines trauma-informed design as "building systems which reduce harm and foster healing." For caregiver platforms, this means:

- **Countering potential abuse** through robust privacy controls and moderation systems
- **Supporting user mistakes** with forgiving interfaces that allow easy corrections
- **Providing clear escape routes** from triggering content or conversations
- **Using content warnings** when discussing sensitive topics

### Building Trust Through Transparency

The UX Content Collective's comprehensive guide (2023) emphasizes eliminating aggressive language and using plain language with clear data policies. For caregivers, trust manifests as:

- **No dark patterns** that manipulate users during vulnerable moments
- **Transparent data practices** explaining exactly how personal information is used
- **Predictable interfaces** that behave consistently and reliably
- **Clear communication** about system limitations and capabilities

### Empowerment and Agency

Rachel Edwards from TPXimpact (2022) shares a powerful example from designing a government service for abuse survivors. A well-intentioned form that constrained users to describe their trauma in one sentence "backfired" by taking away their agency. This illustrates why caregiver platforms must:

- **Offer meaningful choices** in how users engage with content and features
- **Provide easy opt-outs** from any interaction or data collection
- **Enable user control** over their experience and information
- **Avoid constraining expression** of complex emotions or experiences

## From Universal Precautions to Targeted Support

Melissa Eggleston (2022) proposes a "universal precautions" approachassuming any user might have trauma and proactively avoiding common triggers. This preventative approach is particularly crucial for caregiver platforms where users are likely experiencing stress and emotional vulnerability.

### Intersectional Considerations

Trauma-informed care must be intersectional, accounting for how trauma impacts different races, genders, cultures, and communities differently. Historical trauma, systemic oppression, and cultural contexts all shape how individuals experience and process difficult situations.

## Belonging as the Antidote to Othering

The Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley (2023) provides a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive structures that make everyone feel valued and empowered. They define "belonging as the antidote to othering" and call for co-creating new systems that serve all users rather than forcing marginalized people to fit into existing structures.

### Ten Principles for Belonging

Their Belonging Design Principles include:
- Recognizing that the root of many problems is othering
- Affirming that everyone belongs
- Prioritizing structural change over surface-level fixes
- Recognizing and addressing power dynamics
- Fostering agency and co-creation
- Celebrating and valuing diversity

## Targeted Universalism in Practice

john a. powell's concept of targeted universalism offers a powerful strategy: set universal goals (like creating a platform where all caregivers feel safe and supported) while implementing tailored approaches for different groups. For caregiver platforms, this might mean:

- **Universal goal**: Every caregiver feels empowered and supported
- **Targeted approaches**: 
  - Specific resources for LGBTQ+ caregivers navigating family dynamics
  - Culturally relevant content for caregivers from different ethnic backgrounds
  - Specialized features for young caregivers balancing school and care duties
  - Adapted interfaces for caregivers with disabilities

## Real-World Applications

### Chayn's Eight Design Principles

Chayn, a survivor-led tech nonprofit, has developed trauma-informed design principles through a decade of co-creating services with abuse survivors. Their approach prioritizes trust and safety over aesthetics and accepts complexity over "flattening" experiences. Their eight principles include Safety, Agency, Equity, and notably, Hoperecognizing the importance of fostering positive possibilities even in difficult circumstances.

### Televeda's Virtual Talking Circles

Televeda's case study (2024) demonstrates culturally adaptive trauma-informed design in action. They created online peer support groups for seniors and veterans modeled on Indigenous talking circles, integrating:
- Cultural practices like prayer music and talking tokens
- Circular layouts that honor traditions
- Private, supportive spaces that respect cultural values
- Options for family caregiver involvement

## Design Justice and Community Co-Creation

Sasha Costanza-Chock's Design Justice framework (2020) centers marginalized voices in the design process and seeks to redistribute power. A recent example is the development of feminist chatbots for gender-based violence survivors (Henry et al., 2024), which embedded:
- Content warnings and privacy safeguards
- Multiple escape options to avoid retraumatization
- Empathetic, inclusive language
- Survivor-centered, strengths-based approaches

## Implementing Thoughtful Design

Exygy's Thoughtful Design methodology blends human-centered design with equity-centered, inclusive, and trauma-informed practices. Their four principles provide a practical framework:

1. **Recognize exclusion** actively and continuously
2. **Focus on the margins** by centering those most impacted
3. **Co-create with people with lived experience** as true partners
4. **Design for users' cognitive and emotional states**, not just functional needs

## Practical Guidelines for Caregiver Platforms

### Content Design
- Use compassionate, non-judgmental language
- Provide content warnings for potentially triggering topics
- Offer multiple ways to access and process information
- Include diverse voices and experiences in content creation

### Interface Design
- Create calm, uncluttered interfaces that reduce cognitive load
- Use soft, soothing color palettes and avoid aggressive visual elements
- Provide clear navigation with easy ways to pause or exit
- Design for one-handed use (caregivers often multitask)

### Feature Development
- Build in regular check-ins and emotional support prompts
- Create peer support features that foster community
- Provide resources in multiple formats (text, audio, video)
- Enable customization to meet individual needs and preferences

### Privacy and Security
- Implement robust privacy controls with clear, simple settings
- Never share personal data without explicit, informed consent
- Provide anonymous or pseudonymous options for sensitive features
- Create secure spaces for vulnerable conversations

## The Critical Gap: What's Missing in Today's Caregiver Technology

While the tech industry races to inject AI into every conceivable application, most caregiver tools remain fundamentally disconnected from the lived realities of those they claim to serve. The majority of caregiver apps and platforms fall into predictable patterns:

- **Task Management Theater**: Endless to-do lists and medication reminders that add to cognitive burden rather than alleviating it
- **Data Extraction Disguised as Support**: Platforms that prioritize collecting health metrics over providing emotional sustenance
- **One-Size-Fits-None Solutions**: Generic interfaces that assume all caregivers have the same needs, resources, and cultural contexts
- **Toxic Positivity**: Interfaces that push "self-care" messaging while ignoring systemic barriers and trauma

### The AI Rush and Its Discontents

The current obsession with AI-driven caregiving solutions often amplifies these problems. We see:

- **Algorithmic Gaslighting**: AI chatbots that respond to expressions of caregiver burnout with generic "have you tried yoga?" suggestions
- **Surveillance Wrapped in Care**: Tools that monitor and judge caregiver "performance" rather than supporting their journey
- **Cultural Incompetence at Scale**: AI systems trained on narrow datasets that fail to recognize diverse caregiving practices and values

### Extending to Patient Advocacy: The Missing Bridge

The disconnect becomes even more glaring when we consider patient advocacy. Current tools create artificial boundaries between "caregiver" and "advocate" roles, failing to recognize that:

- **Advocacy is Care Work**: Fighting insurance denials, navigating healthcare systems, and demanding better treatment ARE forms of caregiving
- **Trauma Compounds**: Patient advocates often face secondary trauma from battling institutional indifference while supporting someone in crisis
- **Power Dynamics Matter**: Most platforms ignore the power imbalances advocates must navigate with medical professionals, insurers, and institutions

### What Trauma-Informed Patient Advocacy Tools Could Look Like

Imagine digital tools that actually understood the advocate's journey:

- **Rage-Friendly Interfaces**: Safe spaces to express anger at systemic failures without being tone-policed by an algorithm
- **Collective Power Building**: Features that connect advocates facing similar battles, building solidarity rather than isolation
- **Trauma-Aware Documentation**: Tools that help advocates document medical neglect or discrimination without retraumatization
- **Cultural Battle Readiness**: Resources that acknowledge how race, class, and other identities affect advocacy outcomes

### The Real Design Challenge

The core issue isn't technical—it's philosophical. Most caregiver and advocacy tools are designed from a place of privilege, by people who've never had to:
- Choose between work and attending a loved one's chemotherapy
- Fight for basic dignity in a hospital setting
- Navigate caregiving while experiencing their own chronic illness
- Advocate in a second language or across cultural barriers

Until we center these experiences—not as edge cases but as core use cases—we'll continue building tools that harm more than they help.

### The Urgency for "Integrity Designers"

As Dietkus notes, quoting Ron Bronson from 18F: "We need designers who are dispersed and savvy and understand the implications of design. We need integrity designers to be proactive and minimize the damage of what is going to happen." In the context of caregiving tools, this means designers who:

- Understand that their code can literally impact life-and-death decisions
- Recognize that a poorly designed form can mean the difference between receiving care or being denied
- Accept responsibility for the secondary trauma their interfaces might cause
- Work actively to minimize harm rather than just avoiding liability

### Why Design Needs Social Work

Victor and Sylvia Margolin observed in 2002 that "many professionals share the goals of designers who want to do socially responsible work... and therefore propose that both designers and helping professionals [social workers] find ways to work together." This collaboration is especially critical for caregiver platforms because:

- **Social workers see the impacts of bad design daily**: They witness how confusing interfaces, inaccessible features, and culturally insensitive designs harm the most vulnerable
- **Design without lived experience is dangerous**: As Tad Hirsch warns in "Practicing Without a License: Design Research as Psychotherapy," designers can exploit vulnerable participants for "source material" without understanding the harm they cause
- **Healing happens through connection**: The social work principle that "care and healing happen through connection, compassion, critical consciousness, and meaningful shared decision-making" must inform our digital spaces

## The Intersection of Anti-Racism and Trauma-Informed Design

As Dietkus discovered working with ChiByDesign on Ohio's foster care system: "To be anti-racist, you must be trauma-informed. And if you're going to be trauma-informed or trauma-responsive, you must commit to anti-racist work in structures and systems that have been designed."

This is particularly crucial for caregiver platforms because:
- **Systemic racism creates trauma**: Caregivers of color face additional barriers, discrimination, and medical racism that compound their caregiving challenges
- **Historical trauma impacts present care**: Generational experiences of medical exploitation and harm affect how communities engage with healthcare systems
- **Intersectionality multiplies burden**: LGBTQ+ caregivers of color, immigrant caregivers, and those at other intersections face layered challenges that single-axis design thinking cannot address

## Moving Forward with Intention

Creating truly trauma-informed and inclusive digital experiences for caregivers requires ongoing commitment to these principles. It means continuously listening to users, especially those from marginalized communities, and being willing to evolve based on their feedback.

As Dietkus powerfully states: "Becoming trauma-informed is a radical act. As we design with, by, and for, we must continue to do transformational, relational work—not that which is transactional and extractive."

For caregiver platforms, this radical act means:
- **Rejecting extractive design**: Stop mining caregivers' pain for "insights" without giving back
- **Building with, not for**: Include caregivers as co-designers and decision-makers, not just research subjects
- **Committing to ongoing learning**: Trauma-informed design isn't a checklist—it requires "constant attention, caring awareness, sensitivity, and possibly a cultural change at an organizational level"

As we build digital tools for caregivers, we must remember that behind every interaction is a human being navigating one of life's most challenging journeys. By embedding trauma-informed and inclusive design principles into every aspect of our platforms, we can create digital spaces that don't just avoid harm but actively support healing, connection, and empowerment.

The intersection of trauma-informed design, belonging frameworks, and targeted universalism offers a robust toolkit for creating caregiver platforms that truly serve all users. By centering the experiences of those most marginalized and building with rather than for our communities, we can create digital experiences that honor the full complexity and diversity of caregiving journeys.
