## 🚧 Remaining Work

### Phase 2: Additional Sections (6 sections)
These follow the same patterns as completed sections. Create using similar structure:

#### 1. ProvokeReframe.tsx
**Purpose**: Challenge status quo ("Guessing stress isn't self-care. Measuring it is.")

**Structure**:
```tsx
- Headline: Bold provocation
- Comparison table: Old way vs. New way
- Video: "See the difference (1 min)"
- CTA: "Get your burnout score now"
```

**Reference**: LANDING_PAGE_PRINCIPLES.md, Section 7

---

#### 2. MissionStory.tsx
**Purpose**: Emotional connection ("Why We Built GiveCare")

**Structure**:
```tsx
- Headline: "Why We Built GiveCare"
- Story: 3 paragraphs (reality → problem → solution)

- CTA: "Meet caregivers who've lowered their burnout"
```

**Reference**: PRODUCT_ANALYSIS.md, Section 8

---

#### 3. P1P6Principles.tsx
**Purpose**: Showcase trauma-informed design

**Structure**:
```tsx
- Headline: "How We Support You: P1-P6 Principles"
- Grid: 2x3 layout
- Each principle:
  - Title (P1: Acknowledge → Answer → Advance)
  - Description (plain language explanation)
- CTA: "Experience trauma-informed support"
```

**Content from**: give-care-prod/src/instructions.py (lines 18-38)

---

#### 4. ProofCarousel.tsx
**Purpose**: Rotating proof points/metrics

**Structure**:
```tsx
- Auto-carousel (5 slides, 4 seconds each)
- Slides:
  1. "70% response rate Day 7"
  2. "60%+ improve 5+ points by Day 90"
  3. "Sub-2s response time"
  4. "100% crisis accuracy"
  5. "50%+ complete assessments <3 min"
- Each: Large number + icon + description
```

**Reference**: PRODUCT_ANALYSIS.md, Section 8 (Success Metrics)

---

#### 5. PricingSection.tsx
**Purpose**: Subscription plan showcase

**Structure**:
```tsx
- Two cards side-by-side:
  - Monthly: $29.97/month
  - Annual: $299.70/year (POPULAR badge, "Save $59.94")
- Features list (5 bullets each)
- CTA: "Start Free Assessment"
- Trust signals: "Cancel anytime · HIPAA compliant"
```

**Integration**: LANDING_PAGE_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md (Stripe setup)

---

#### 6. PhilosophySection.tsx
**Purpose**: End with core principles

**Structure**:
```tsx
- Headline: "Our Principles"
- 4 pillars (2x2 grid):
  1. Trauma-Informed First
  2. Clinically Validated
  3. Evidence-Based Only
  4. Always Safe
- Each: Icon + title + description
```

**Reference**: PRODUCT_ANALYSIS.md, Section 5

---

### Phase 3: Update Existing Sections (2 files)

#### 1. HowItWorksSection.tsx
**Current**: Technical steps
**New**: Benefit-driven steps

**Changes**:
```tsx
Step 1:
  - Headline: "Know exactly how stressed you are"
  - Sub: "Clinical checks via SMS (<3 min)"

Step 2:
  - Headline: "Get strategies that work"
  - Sub: "Evidence-based, pressure-zone matched"

Step 3:
  - Headline: "See proof you're improving"
  - Sub: "Score tracking + milestones"
```

---

#### 2. Testimonials.tsx
**Current**: Corporate testimonials
**New**: Authentic text-message style

**Replace quotes with**:
```tsx
const TESTIMONIALS = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Sarah",
    content: "This is the first thing that gets caregiving"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Mike",
    content: "I can't believe I can see my stress going down"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Jen",
    content: "I needed this 5 years ago"
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Carlos",
    content: "Finally, support that doesn't waste my time"
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "Tracy",
    content: "The P1-P6 principles changed everything"
  }
];
```

**Keep**: Same layout, just update quotes

---

### Phase 4: Homepage Integration (1 file)

#### app/page.tsx
**Replace imports**:
```tsx
import NewHero from "./components/sections/NewHero";
import BurnoutScoreSection from "./components/sections/BurnoutScoreSection";
import FeaturesBentoGrid from "./components/sections/FeaturesBentoGrid";
import ProvokeReframe from "./components/sections/ProvokeReframe";

import P1P6Principles from "./components/sections/P1P6Principles";
import ProofCarousel from "./components/sections/ProofCarousel";

  <FeaturesBentoGrid />
  <ProvokeReframe />
  <HowItWorksSection /> {/* Updated */}

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Implementation (Recommended)
1. Create 6 remaining sections using patterns from completed ones
2. Update 2 existing sections (HowItWorks, Testimonials)
3. Integrate all into homepage
4. Test + polish

### Option B: Test What's Built
1. Import NewHero in page.tsx
2. Test in browser
3. Validate design decisions
4. Then continue with remaining sections

### Option C: Pause for Assets
1. Gather needed assets:
   - Caregiver photos (diverse, authentic)
   - Video recordings (or use placeholders)
   - Logo/brand assets
2. Resume implementation with real content

---

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### For Remaining Sections:
- **Copy patterns** from completed sections (NewHero, BurnoutScoreSection)
- **Use ScrollAnimationWrapper** for entrance animations
- **Follow spacing**: py-20 for sections, mb-12 for headings
- **Color scheme**: amber-X for primary, base-X for backgrounds
- **Icons**: Use heroicons (already imported in other sections)

### For Updates:
- **HowItWorksSection**: Just update content strings, keep structure
- **Testimonials**: Just update TESTIMONIALS array, keep component logic
