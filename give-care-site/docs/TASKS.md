## ✅ DONE

### 2025-01-18 (Latest)
- [x] **Stripe Integration Simplification (Option 1)** - Consolidated Stripe data into users table for cleaner architecture
  - **What worked**: Eliminated separate stripe_customers and stripe_subscriptions tables, storing Stripe IDs directly in users table
  - **Result**: Simplified webhook processing, reduced database complexity, fewer join operations needed
  - **Architecture Changes**:
    - Added stripe_customer_id and stripe_subscription_id fields to users table
    - Updated webhook handlers to work directly with users table
    - Removed StripeCustomerProfile and StripeSubscriptionProfile models
    - Simplified subscription status tracking with single source of truth
  - **Database Migration**: No migration needed - fields already exist, removed unused table references
  - **Impact**: Cleaner codebase, faster queries, simplified subscription management flow

- [x] **Field Standardization: user_age → age** - Renamed user_age field to age throughout entire codebase
  - **What worked**: Comprehensive find-and-replace across models, profile extraction, guardrails, and display logic
  - **Result**: Consistent field naming eliminates confusion between user age and care recipient age
  - **Files Updated**: utils/models.py, utils/profile_manager.py, utils/guardrails.py, main.py
  - **Profile Collection**: Updated field collection to use "age" consistently in prompts and validation
  - **Impact**: Cleaner code, consistent naming convention, easier maintenance

- [x] **Deployment Documentation Cleanup** - Removed obsolete deployment files and documentation
  - **What worked**: Eliminated outdated reasoning processor deployment docs that no longer matched current architecture
  - **Result**: Cleaner repository, no confusing or incorrect deployment instructions
  - **Removed**: deployment/README.md, deployment/reasoning-processor.service
  - **Impact**: Prevents confusion about deployment process, maintains only current relevant documentation

### 2025-01-18 (Previous)
- [x] **Stripe Webhook Integration Complete** - Fixed signature verification and subscription record creation
  - **What worked**: Identified and resolved two critical webhook processing issues preventing subscription completion
  - **Result**: Webhooks now successfully process all Stripe events and create proper subscription records
  - **Issue 1 - Async Signature Verification**: `constructEvent()` → `constructEventAsync()` for Deno Edge Runtime
  - **Issue 2 - Subscription Record Creation**: Added missing `created_at` field to stripe_subscriptions upsert
  - **Issue 3 - RCS Switching Problem**: Disabled RCS webhook in Twilio to prevent automatic protocol switching

  - **Impact**: Subscription flow now works end-to-end with proper webhook processing and data persistence

- [x] **Webhook RLS Policy Fix** - Fixed Stripe webhook 500 errors caused by missing service-role policies
  - **What worked**: Identified that stripe_customers and stripe_subscriptions tables lacked service-role RLS policies
  - **Result**: Webhooks now successfully process subscription events without 500 errors
  - **Root Cause**: stripe_events and users tables had service-role policies, but stripe_customers/stripe_subscriptions only had authenticated user policies
  - **Fix**: Added service-role policies for ALL operations on webhook tables using migration `add_service_role_policies_for_webhooks`
  - **Testing**: Verified webhook-style upsert operations work correctly with new policies
  - **Impact**: invoice.payment_succeeded events now process successfully, fixing subscription flow completion

- [x] **Comprehensive Profile Collection System** - Overhauled onboarding to collect ALL user and care recipient fields
  - **What worked**: Complete redesign requiring ALL 13 fields (7 user + 6 care recipient) before marking onboarding complete
  - **Result**: Empathetic profile collection that explains WHY each field helps provide better care support
  - **Architecture**: 
    - ALL_USER_FIELDS: name, email, location, user_age, family_members, energy_level, notes
    - ALL_RECIPIENT_FIELDS: name, relationship, age, medical_conditions, location, notes
    - Progressive prompting with completeness tracking (e.g., "Profile: 8/13 fields (61.5%)")
    - Natural conversation flow: "Help with their question, then naturally ask: [next_question]"
  - **UX Enhancement**: Purpose-driven questions like "What city are you in? This helps me find local support services"

## 📝 NOTES & LEARNINGS

### Database Efficiency Analysis (2025-06-17)
- **Connection Overhead**: Creating new Supabase clients per operation bypassed connection pooling
  - **Pattern**: get_supabase() called 3-7 times per SMS, each creating fresh client
  - **Impact**: 50-100ms overhead per SMS, wasted authentication cycles
  - **Fix**: Singleton pattern in utils/db.py eliminates redundant client creation

- **Race Conditions**: Update-then-insert patterns vulnerable to concurrent requests
  - **Pattern**: SELECT → UPDATE → INSERT fallback across profile operations
  - **Impact**: Duplicate records, inconsistent data, failed operations
  - **Fix**: Atomic upserts with on_conflict parameters prevent race conditions

- **N+1 Query Anti-Pattern**: Profile updates requiring multiple sequential queries
  - **Pattern**: User lookup → Care recipient update → Insert fallback
  - **Impact**: 2-3x more database trips than necessary
  - **Fix**: Batch operations and concurrent execution reduce query count

### Previous Bug Analysis (2025-06-15)
- **extract_profile Agent Name Error**: Fixed with `name` parameter in Agent() calls
- **Database Query Inefficiency**: Resolved with singleton pattern and atomic operations

### Architecture Insights  
- **Agno-Native Approach**: Using Agno's built-in capabilities (reasoning, memory, conversation state) is more reliable than custom implementations
- **Structured Outputs**: `response_model` approach is more robust than tool-based profile extraction
- **Database Patterns**: PostgreSQL upsert operations prevent race conditions better than select-then-insert patterns  
- **Testing Strategy**: Separate Phoenix projects prevent production trace pollution during testing
- **Memory Management**: Let Agno handle agentic memory automatically vs complex hybrid approaches

### What Works Well
- **Natural Conversations**: Agno agents handle conversation flow better than rigid state machines  
- **Structured Output Extraction**: Using `response_model` for profile extraction vs. tool orchestration
- **Agno-Native Memory**: Built-in agentic memory vs. custom MemoryManager implementations
- **Atomic Database Operations**: Upsert patterns eliminate concurrency issues
- **Singleton Connection Pattern**: Single Supabase client dramatically reduces overhead
- **Batch Operations**: Concurrent database updates improve efficiency
- **Database Functions**: Server-side atomic operations prevent race conditions
- **Knowledge Base Simplification**: Following Agno docs patterns vs. complex error handling
- **Simplified Stripe Integration**: Direct storage in users table vs. normalized separate tables
- **Consistent Field Naming**: Single "age" field eliminates user_age vs age confusion

### Technical Decisions
- **Phoenix Tracing**: Tests use `givecare-testing` project to separate from production traces
- **Content-Type**: Twilio requires "application/xml" not "text/xml" for SMS responses  
- **Agent Architecture**: Fresh agent instances per request prevent user data bleeding
