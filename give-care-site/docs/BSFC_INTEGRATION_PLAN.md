# BSFC Assessment Integration Plan

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Email-based assessment flow fully implemented

---

## üìß Email-Based Lead Capture Flow

**New Approach**: Results delivered via email (not shown on web)

**Flow**:
1. User answers 10 BSFC-s questions (one per page)
2. After question 10: **Email capture form** appears
   - "Enter your email to receive your complete results"
   - Not "to see" ‚Äî "to receive" (feels like value, not a gate)
3. Submit ‚Üí Results email sent immediately
4. Redirect to thank-you page: "Check your email!"

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Feels less manipulative (not withholding info)
- ‚úÖ Email = valuable deliverable users can save/reference
- ‚úÖ Sets up natural nurture sequence (Day 3, Day 7)
- ‚úÖ Professional and trustworthy positioning
- ‚úÖ Higher perceived value than web-only results

**Email Contains**:
- Full burden score (0-30) with color-coded interpretation
- Top 3 pressure zones with descriptions
- Band-specific messaging (Mild/Moderate/Severe)
- "Start Your Free Trial" CTA
- BSFC attribution footer

---

## ‚úÖ Completed: BSFC Credibility Integration

### Changes Made:

**1. NewHero Trust Signals**
- Added: "Clinically Validated (BSFC)" as first trust signal
- Replaced: "Sub-2s Response Time" (moved to second position)
- Result: Users immediately see clinical backing

**2. BurnoutScoreSection**
- Added footer callout in "Why measuring matters" box
- Text: "Based on the BSFC (Burden Scale for Family Caregivers) ‚Äî a clinically validated tool developed by Erlangen University Hospital and used across Europe in 20 languages."
- Result: Users understand the science behind the score

**3. FeaturesBentoGrid (Clinical Assessments Tile)**
- Replaced generic description
- New: "BSFC (Burden Scale for Family Caregivers) ‚Äî validated by Erlangen University Hospital. Available in 20 languages. Takes 3-5 minutes."
- Result: Specific tool name + validation source

**4. All CTAs Unchanged**
- Keeping: "Start Free Assessment"
- Simple, clear, non-jargony

## üöß Next Phase: Build Assessment Page

### Assessment Flow Options

#### Option A: BSFC-s (Short Version - RECOMMENDED)
**Questions**: 10 items
**Time**: 3 minutes
**Score Range**: 0-30
**Why**: Higher completion rate, still validated

**Questions**:
1. My life satisfaction has suffered because of the care
2. I often feel physically exhausted
3. From time to time I wish I could "run away" from the situation
4. Sometimes I don't really feel like "myself" as before
5. Since I have been a caregiver my financial situation has decreased
6. My health is affected by the care situation
7. The care takes a lot of my own strength
8. I feel torn between the demands of my environment and the care
9. I am worried about my future because of the care
10. My relationships with others are suffering as a result of the care

**Scale**: Strongly agree (3), Agree (2), Disagree (1), Strongly disagree (0)

**Scoring**:
- Sum all responses (0-30 total)
- **Validated thresholds** (derived from full BSFC):
  - **0-14**: Mild burden (not at increased risk)
  - **15-19**: Moderate burden (increased risk)
  - **20-30**: Severe burden (very high risk)
- Scaling method: Full BSFC non-dementia cutoffs √ó 0.357 (30/84 ratio)

---

#### Option B: BSFC Full (28 Questions)
**Questions**: 28 items
**Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Score Range**: 0-84
**Why**: More comprehensive, better for deeper insight

**Scoring Tables**:
- **Dementia caregivers**: 0-35 (mild), 36-45 (moderate), 46-84 (severe)
- **Non-dementia caregivers**: 0-41 (mild), 42-55 (moderate), 56-84 (severe)

**Questions**: (See provided PDF)

### Recommended Flow: BSFC-s (Short)

#### Page 1: `/assessment` (Intro)
```tsx
<section>
  <h1>Free Caregiver Burden Assessment</h1>
  <p>Take the BSFC-s (Burden Scale for Family Caregivers)</p>

  <div className="info-cards">

#### Page 2: `/assessment/questions` (Assessment)

**Layout Option A: All Questions on One Page**
```tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {questions.map((q, i) => (
    <div key={i} className="question-card">
      <h3>Question {i + 1} of 10</h3>
      <p className="question-text">{q.text}</p>

      <div className="radio-group">
        <label>
          <input type="radio" name={`q${i}`} value="3" required />
          Strongly agree
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" name={`q${i}`} value="2" />
          Agree
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" name={`q${i}`} value="1" />
          Disagree
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" name={`q${i}`} value="0" />
          Strongly disagree
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
  ))}

  <button type="submit">Calculate My Score</button>
</form>
```

**Layout Option B: One Question Per Page (Multi-Step)**
```tsx
// Progress: 3 of 10
<div className="question-card">
  <ProgressBar current={3} total={10} />

  <h2>Question 3 of 10</h2>
  <p className="question-text">{currentQuestion.text}</p>

  <div className="button-group">
    <button onClick={() => answer(3)}>Strongly agree</button>
    <button onClick={() => answer(2)}>Agree</button>
    <button onClick={() => answer(1)}>Disagree</button>
    <button onClick={() => answer(0)}>Strongly disagree</button>
  </div>

  <button onClick={goBack}>‚Üê Back</button>
</div>
```

**Recommendation**: Option B (one per page) - Less overwhelming, mobile-friendly

## üéØ Pressure Zone Identification (From Responses)

Map BSFC-s questions to pressure zones:

```typescript
function identifyZones(responses: number[]): PressureZone[] {
  const zones = [];

  // Physical Exhaustion (Q2, Q6, Q7)
  const physical = responses[1] + responses[5] + responses[6];
  if (physical >= 6) {
    zones.push({ name: "Physical Exhaustion", severity: "high" });
  }

  // Emotional Burden (Q1, Q3, Q4)
  const emotional = responses[0] + responses[2] + responses[3];
  if (emotional >= 6) {
    zones.push({ name: "Emotional Burden", severity: "high" });
  }

  // Financial Strain (Q5)
  if (responses[4] >= 2) {
    zones.push({ name: "Financial Strain", severity: "high" });
  }

  // Social Isolation (Q8, Q10)
  const social = responses[7] + responses[9];
  if (social >= 4) {
    zones.push({ name: "Social Isolation", severity: "high" });
  }

  // Future Worry (Q9)
  if (responses[8] >= 2) {
    zones.push({ name: "Future Uncertainty", severity: "moderate" });
  }

  return zones.slice(0, 3); // Top 3
}
```

## üìä Database Schema (Optional)

If storing assessment responses:

```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT,
  phone TEXT,

  score INTEGER,
  band TEXT, -- "mild", "moderate", "severe"
  pressure_zones JSONB,

## üé® Design Notes

### Color Coding for Results:
- **0-14 (Mild)**: Green gauge, reassuring message
- **15-19 (Moderate)**: Yellow gauge, supportive message
- **20-30 (Severe)**: Orange/red gauge, urgent but hopeful message

### Mobile-First:
- Large tap targets for radio buttons
- Progress bar at top
- One question per screen (vertical scroll minimal)

### Accessibility:
- Radio button labels with full question text
- Keyboard navigation (tab through options)
- ARIA labels for screen readers

---

## üöÄ Quick Start: Build Assessment Page

**Option 1: Build Now**
- Say "build assessment" and I'll create all 3 pages + API routes

**Option 2: Test Current Changes**
- Run `pnpm dev` to see BSFC credibility updates

**Option 3: Plan First**
- Review this document, decide on scoring thresholds for BSFC-s

## üß™ Testing the Assessment Flow

Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then test the complete flow:
1. Navigate to homepage ‚Üí Click "Start Free Assessment"
2. `/assessment` ‚Üí See intro page with BSFC info
3. Click "Start Assessment" ‚Üí `/assessment/questions`
4. Answer all 10 questions (one per page with progress bar)
5. **Email capture form appears** ‚Üí "Enter your email to receive your complete results"
6. Submit email ‚Üí Results sent via email API
7. Redirect to `/assessment/results` ‚Üí "Check Your Email!" thank-you page

**Current Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ **Emails send automatically via Resend API**
- Results delivered to user's inbox immediately after completing assessment
- Console logs show success confirmation: `‚úÖ Assessment results email sent to: [email]`
- Audience ID configured: users auto-added to newsletter list (if `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` set)

**Email Contains**:
- Full burden score (0-30) with interpretation
- Top 3 pressure zones with descriptions
- Band-specific color coding (green/yellow/orange)
- "Start Your Free Trial" CTA
- BSFC citation footer

**Why Email-Based Results Feel Better**:
- Not withholding info behind a gate ‚Äî users RECEIVE a deliverable
- Email = valuable asset they can save and reference
- Sets up natural nurture sequence (Day 3, Day 7 follow-ups)
- Professional and non-manipulative
