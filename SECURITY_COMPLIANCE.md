## HIPAA Compliance Roadmap

### ‚ùå **DO NOT CLAIM (Until Compliance Complete)**

**Avoid these terms/claims:**
- ‚ùå "HIPAA-compliant platform" (not true until all BAAs signed)
- ‚ùå "HIPAA-certified" (HIPAA doesn't certify)
- ‚ùå "Protected Health Information (PHI) safeguarded" (not true without BAAs)
- ‚ùå "Medical-grade security" (vague, misleading)
- ‚ùå "Healthcare-grade compliance" (implies HIPAA without saying it)

**Why:**
- Legal liability: False HIPAA claims can result in $100‚Äì$50,000 per violation
- Trust damage: Healthcare partners will audit your compliance before partnerships
- Competitive disadvantage: Competitors can point out gaps if you overclaim

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is GiveCare HIPAA-compliant?
Not yet. We use HIPAA-compliant infrastructure (SOC 2 Type II, encrypted data, BAA with OpenAI), but we are still executing Business Associate Agreements with our database and SMS providers. Full HIPAA compliance is targeted for Q1 2026.

### Can I use GiveCare for protected health information (PHI)?
Not until Q1 2026 when all BAAs are executed. Currently, we recommend using GiveCare for wellness and support conversations that do not include identifiable health information (specific diagnoses, medications, treatment plans).

### Is my data encrypted?
Yes. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We use industry-standard encryption across all systems.

### Do you sell my data?
No. We never sell or share user data with third parties. Your conversations are private and used only to provide the GiveCare service.

### Can I delete my data?
Yes. You can request account deletion at any time. We will permanently delete your data within 30 days of your request.

### Who can access my conversations?
Only you and the GiveCare AI agents. No human staff can access your conversations unless you explicitly request support and provide consent. All access is logged.

### What happens if there's a data breach?
We have incident response procedures in place. If a breach occurs, we will notify affected users within the timeframes required by applicable laws (HIPAA, GDPR, state breach notification laws).
