# Gap Analysis & Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Owner:** Ali Madad
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Resources) + P1 (Medium - Metrics)

---

## Executive Summary

**What's Working:** All "poke" features (5/5), proactive messaging, assessments, burnout scoring, working memory, admin dashboard.

**What's Missing:** Resource system (5 vs 20 claimed), unsupported B2B metrics, HIPAA (low priority for B2C).

**Immediate Action:** Fix marketing claims (4 days), then add 10 interventions (1 week).

---

## Gap Summary

| Priority | Gap | Impact | Fix Timeline |
|----------|-----|--------|--------------|
| üî¥ **P0** | Resources: 5 generic vs. 20/ZIP-based claimed | Legal/trust risk | Phase 1 (4d) + Phase 2 (1w) |
| üü° **P1** | Unsupported B2B metrics (40% calls, 20% churn) | Partner credibility | Phase 1 (included) |
| üü¢ **P2** | HIPAA compliance (Convex/Twilio BAAs) | Only if B2B healthcare | Defer unless needed |

**Total Gaps:** 3 (down from original 16 - most claims were actually supported by implemented features)

---

## What's Actually Working ‚úÖ

### Core Platform (14 features)
1. Multi-agent system (3 agents: main, crisis, assessment)
2. Clinical assessments (4 tools: EMA, CWBS, REACH-II, SDOH)
3. Burnout scoring (0-100 composite, 5 bands)
4. Pressure zones (top 2-3 stressors identified)
5. Proactive check-ins (tiered by burnout level)
6. Dormant reactivation (days 7, 14, 30)
7. Crisis follow-ups (7-stage cascade)
8. Admin dashboard (live at dash.givecareapp.com)
9. Stripe integration (subscriptions, coupons, webhooks)
10. Rate limiting (5 layers: token bucket algorithm)

### OpenPoke Intelligence Layer (5/5 "poke" features)
11. **RRULE personalized schedules** ‚úÖ (`convex/crons.ts:74-90`, `convex/triggers.ts`)
12. **Conversation summarization** ‚úÖ (`convex/crons.ts:93-113`, `convex/summarization.ts`)
13. **Engagement watcher** ‚úÖ (`convex/crons.ts:116-129`, `convex/watchers.ts`)
14. **Wellness trend watcher** ‚úÖ (`convex/crons.ts:132-150`, `convex/watchers.ts`)
15. **Working memory system** ‚úÖ (`src/tools.ts:508`, `convex/functions/memories.ts`, `tests/workingMemory.test.ts` - 35 tests)

**Test Coverage:** 235+ passing tests across all features

---

## Gap 1: Resource System (P0 - Critical)

### Current State

**File:** `give-care-app/src/interventionData.ts` (lines 25-51)

```typescript
export const ZONE_INTERVENTIONS: Record<string, Intervention> = {
  emotional_wellbeing: { title: 'Crisis Text Line', desc: '...', helpful: 92 },
  physical_health: { title: 'Respite Care Finder', desc: 'Find temporary care support in your area', helpful: 78 },  // GENERIC
  financial_concerns: { title: 'Financial Assistance Programs', desc: '...', helpful: 81 },  // GENERIC
  time_management: { title: 'Caregiving Task Checklist', desc: '...', helpful: 79 },  // GENERIC
  social_support: { title: 'Local Caregiver Support Groups', desc: '...', helpful: 88 },  // GENERIC
};
```

**Reality:** 5 generic text strings
**No:** ZIP filtering, local lookup, API integration

### Marketing Claims (Overstated)

**Internal Docs:**
- `docs/FEATURES.md` line 77: ~~"20 Evidence-Based Strategies"~~ ‚Üí **Fixed to "5 (expanding)"**
- `docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` line 300: ~~"10,000+ evidence-based resources"~~ ‚Üí **Fixed to "5 curated"**

**Marketing Site (give-care-site):**
- "Resources matched to your specific needs‚Äîrespite funding, local support groups"
- "the Tuesday respite program 10 minutes from you that takes Medicaid"
- "Found 3 respite services in your area"

### Remediation

**Phase 1: Remove ZIP/Local Claims (4 days)**

Changes needed in `give-care-site`:

1. **FeaturesBentoGrid.tsx**
```diff
- "Resources matched to your specific needs‚Äîrespite funding, local support groups, practical strategies."
+ "Evidence-based strategies matched to your pressure zones‚Äîcrisis support, wellness practices, caregiver guidance."
```

2. **about/page.tsx**
```diff
- "the Tuesday respite program 10 minutes from you that takes Medicaid."
+ "strategies matched to your exact pressure zones. Local resource directory launching Q1 2026."
```

3. **how-it-works/page.tsx**
```diff
- "Found 3 respite services in your area"
+ "Respite Care Resource Guide - Finding temporary care support in your state"
```

**Phase 2: Add 10 Interventions (1 week, $3k)**
- Expand `interventionData.ts` from 5 to 15 strategies (2-3 per zone)
- Research evidence-based interventions for each pressure zone
- Add to static data structure

**Phase 3: ZIP-Based Resources (Q1 2026, $28k-40k/year)**
- Build resource database (migrate to `knowledgeBase` table)
- Integrate CarelinQ API or Eldercare Locator API
- Add geolocation filtering by ZIP code
- Test with 100+ real ZIP codes

---

## Gap 2: Unsupported B2B Metrics (P1 - Medium)

### Claims to Verify

**File:** `give-care-site/app/partners/long-term-care/components/Features.tsx`

1. **"40% fewer after-hours calls"**
   - Do you have pilot data (n=12 families, 90-day study)?
   - If YES: Keep claim, add citation
   - If NO: Remove metric, keep benefit ("Your staff stays rested")

2. **"20-30% churn reduction"**
   - This is a projection from engagement watcher implementation
   - Change to: "Expected 20-30% churn reduction (engagement monitoring)"
   - Or remove until you have real data

3. **Other partner metrics** (need to audit full partner pages)
   - "50% fewer questions" - ‚úÖ SUPPORTED (working memory reduces repeats)
   - Check for any other unsupported claims

### Remediation

**Action:** Audit all partner pages for metric claims (1 day)
- Search for: "%", "reduction", "increase", "fewer", "more"
- Verify each claim against backend capabilities or pilot data
- Remove or qualify claims without evidence

---

## Gap 3: HIPAA Compliance (P2 - Low Priority)

### Current State

**What You Have:**
- ‚úÖ OpenAI BAA signed (AI processing covered)
- ‚úÖ SOC 2 Type II infrastructure (Convex)
- ‚úÖ Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå Convex BAA NOT signed (database)
- ‚ùå Twilio BAA NOT signed (SMS channel - $2k/month HIPAA tier)

### Strategic Decision Required

**Are you targeting B2B healthcare?**

**Option A: B2C Consumer Focus (Recommended)**
- Skip HIPAA compliance for now
- Focus on consumer wellness (not medical)
- Defer HIPAA until you have enterprise healthcare contracts
- **Budget:** $0

**Option B: B2B Healthcare Focus**
- Execute Convex + Twilio BAAs (4-6 weeks)
- Upgrade Twilio to HIPAA tier ($2k/month = $24k/year)
- Legal review for Privacy Policy ($1k-3k)
- **Budget:** $27k-39k/year

**Recommendation:** Defer HIPAA (Option A) unless you're actively pursuing nursing home/hospital contracts.
