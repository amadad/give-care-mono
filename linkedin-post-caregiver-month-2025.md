# LinkedIn Post - National Family Caregiver Month 2025

November is National Family Caregiver Month, and this year it hit differently.

Last week, I traveled to DC for the Caregiver Nation Summit hosted by the National Alliance for Caregiving. Two days of powerful testimony—Senator Andy Kim publicly identifying as a caregiver on the Senate floor, youth caregiver Feylyn Lewis sharing her journey, researchers presenting data on 63 million American caregivers providing $600 billion in unpaid labor annually.

Day 2 was Hill Day—meetings with legislators to push for Older Americans Act reauthorization. I didn't make it.

My 8-month-old got sick while my wife was traveling overseas. I drove back to New York at 4 AM to be home when he woke up.

That's caregiving. You miss the advocacy day because you're living the reality it's trying to address.

This weekend, our local community health fair gave me a different platform. Last year I was on a panel discussing caregiving. This year, I set up a table to talk directly with community members about GiveCare—our AI-powered text-based support system for family caregivers.

My 9-year-old helped set up the booth. (Pictured: the real MVPs of the operation.) He's been eagerly following every AI model update, every coding decision, every feature launch. Watching him understand that technology can reduce human suffering—not just optimize it—has been one of the unexpected gifts of this journey.

We're wrapping up two research papers dropping soon:
- **GiveCare**: How conversational AI can meet caregivers in crisis where they already are (their text messages)
- **Support Bench**: A framework for evaluating caregiver support interventions against real human need

The Caregiver Nation Summit made one thing clear: we don't lack data. We lack translation. We know what caregivers need. The question is whether we have the political will to implement it.

To the 63 million Americans holding the care system together through unpaid labor, sacrifice, and sheer determination—you deserve systems designed around your reality, not policy aspiration.

And to my 9-year-old co-founder: thanks for believing this work matters. It does.
